Bioinformaticians working in these facilities provide computational biology support to medical doctors and principal investigators who are daily dealing with data of patients to analyze. These bioinformatics analysts, although pivotal, usually do not receive formal training for this job. We therefore propose these ten simple rules to guide these bioinformaticians in their work: ten pieces of advice on how to provide bioinformatics support to medical doctors in hospitals. We believe these simple rules can help bioinformatics facility analysts in producing better scientific results and work in a serene and fruitful environment.",None.,Not applicable.,BioData Mining,,,,2023-02-23,2023,2023-02-23,,16,1,6,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chicco, Davide; Jurman, Giuseppe","Chicco, Davide (Institute of Health Policy Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, 155 College Street, M5T 3M7, Toronto, Ontario, Canada); Jurman, Giuseppe (Data Science for Health Unit, Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Via Sommarive 18, 38123, Povo, Trento, Italy)","Chicco, Davide (University of Toronto)","Chicco, Davide (University of Toronto); Jurman, Giuseppe (Fondazione Bruno Kessler)",1,1,,,https://biodatamining.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s13040-023-00326-0,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155674453,31 Biological Sciences; 3102 Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,

Distractor suppression is essential for survival and considered a key aspect of selective attention. Despite the recent and rapidly evolving literature on distractor suppression, we still know little about how the brain suppresses distracting information. What limits progress is that we lack mutually agreed upon principles of how to study the neural basis of distractor suppression and its manifestation in behavior. Here, we offer ten simple rules that we believe are fundamental when investigating distractor suppression. We provide guidelines on how to design conclusive experiments on distractor suppression (Rules 1-3), discuss different types of distractor suppression that need to be distinguished (Rules 4-6), and provide an overview of models of distractor suppression and considerations of how to evaluate distractor suppression statistically (Rules 7-10). Together, these rules provide a concise and comprehensive synopsis of promising advances in the field of distractor suppression. Following these rules will propel research on distractor suppression in important ways, not only by highlighting prominent issues to both new and more advanced researchers in the field, but also by facilitating communication between sub-disciplines.",,,Progress in Neurobiology,,,Attention; Brain; Humans,2022-04-12,2022,2022-04-12,2022-06,213,,102269,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Wöstmann, Malte; Störmer, Viola S; Obleser, Jonas; Addleman, Douglas A; Andersen, Søren K; Gaspelin, Nicholas; Geng, Joy J; Luck, Steven J; Noonan, MaryAnn P; Slagter, Heleen A; Theeuwes, Jan","Wöstmann, Malte (Department of Psychology, University of Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany; Center of Brain, Behavior and Metabolism (CBBM), University of Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany.

This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of IOTA simple rules in initial classification of ovarian tumors by non-experienced examiners who have received simple training.
Materials and method: A prospective single-center study was conducted at Hanoi Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital. Three resident gynecologists trained themselves for two weeks and then received hands-on practice under the supervision of experts for another two weeks. The examiners performed ultrasound on 424 eligible women scheduled for surgery for ovarian tumors and classified the tumors based on IOTA simple rules. The postoperative pathology of ovarian tumors was used as the gold standard.
Results: 90.8 % (385/424) of the tumors were benign. Simple rules were applicable in 399/424 (94.1 %) tumors, with a sensitivity of 84.8 % (95 % CI, 70.2-94.3), specificity of 98.9 % (95 % CI, 97.5-99.7), positive predictive value of 87.5 % (95 % CI, 73.3-95.9), and negative predictive value of 98.6 % (95 % CI, 97.1-99.5). The sensitivity of IOTA simple rules was higher in postmenopausal women (91.7 % vs. 81.0 %), while the specificity was higher in premenopausal women (99.4 % vs. 95.8 %). Accuracy was 100 % in all ten pregnant women were assessed using these rules.
Conclusion: In conclusion, in the hands of non-expert examiners who were trained thoroughly, IOTA simple rules are a simple and efficient tool for clinical practice in centers where expert radiologists in gynecology are not always available. The training program is simple and could be applied widely in other clinical centers. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the IOTA simple rules in assessing ovarian tumors among pregnant women.",Declaration of competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Heliyon,,,,2024-01-07,2024,2024-01-07,2024-01,10,2,e24262,All OA; Gold,Article,"Dang Thi Minh, Nguyet; Nguyen Van, Thi; Duong Duc, Huu; Nguyen Tuan, Minh; Duong Thi Tra, Giang; Do Tuan, Dat; Nguyen Tai, Duc","Dang Thi Minh, Nguyet (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hanoi Medical University, 1 Ton That Tung Street, Dong Da District, Hanoi, 100000, Viet Nam.); Nguyen Van, Thi (Department of Quan Su Radiology, K Hospital 43 Quan su Street, Hoan Kiem district, Hanoi, 100000, Viet Nam.); Duong Duc, Huu (Department of Quan Su Radiology, K Hospital 43 Quan su Street, Hoan Kiem district, Hanoi, 100000, Viet Nam.); Nguyen Tuan, Minh (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hanoi Medical University, 1 Ton That Tung Street, Dong Da District, Hanoi, 100000, Viet Nam.); Duong Thi Tra, Giang (Department of Delivery, Hanoi Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, 929 La Thanh Street, Ba Dinh district, Hanoi, 100000, Viet Nam.); Do Tuan, Dat (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hanoi Medical University, 1 Ton That Tung Street, Dong Da District, Hanoi, 100000, Viet Nam.); Nguyen Tai, Duc (Prenatal screening and diagnostic center, Hanoi Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, 929 La Thanh Street, Ba Dinh district, Hanoi, 100000, Viet Nam.)","Nguyen Van, Thi (Department of Quan Su Radiology, K Hospital 43 Quan su Street, Hoan Kiem district, Hanoi, 100000, Viet Nam.)","Dang Thi Minh, Nguyet (Hanoi Medical University); Nguyen Van, Thi (Department of Quan Su Radiology, K Hospital 43 Quan su Street, Hoan Kiem district, Hanoi, 100000, Viet Nam.); Duong Duc, Huu (Department of Quan Su Radiology, K Hospital 43 Quan su Street, Hoan Kiem district, Hanoi, 100000, Viet Nam.); Nguyen Tuan, Minh (Hanoi Medical University); Duong Thi Tra, Giang (Department of Delivery, Hanoi Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, 929 La Thanh Street, Ba Dinh district, Hanoi, 100000, Viet Nam.); Do Tuan, Dat (Hanoi Medical University); Nguyen Tai, Duc (Prenatal screening and diagnostic center, Hanoi Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, 929 La Thanh Street, Ba Dinh district, Hanoi, 100000, Viet Nam.)",2,2,,,http://www.cell.com/article/S2405844024002937/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167726055,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3215 Reproductive Medicine,

We begin in Rule 1 with tips on how to consider your purpose, which will guide your search to follow, where, in Rule 2, you'll learn best practices for finding and collecting options. Rules 3 and 4 will help you navigate packages' profiles and explore the extent of their online resources, so that you can be confident in the quality of the package you choose and assured that you'll be able to access support. In Rules 5 and 6, you'll become familiar with how the R Community evaluates packages and learn how to assess the popularity and utility of packages for yourself. Rules 7 and 8 will teach you how to investigate and track package development processes, so you can further evaluate their merit.

An examination on the quotations to an influential neuroimaging meta-analysis guideline,"The collection of recommendations and guidelines for conducting and reporting neuroimaging meta-analyses, called ""Ten simple rules for neuroimaging meta-analysis"" by Müller et al., has been published for a few years. Here, the papers citing this reference were examined to evaluate the rationale of the quotations and what quotation errors existed. In May 2023, an online query via Scopus identified 386 papers citing this reference, 2 of which were inaccessible. The resultant 384 papers were checked to identify the total number of quotations to the reference, the exact quotations, which of the ten recommendations/rules was concerned by each quotation, and if any quotation error existed. Results found that the reference by Müller et al. were quoted 804 times by the 384 papers, meaning an average of 2.1 quotations per paper. Out of the 804 quotations, the three rules that the researchers most frequently referred were the power of the meta-analysis (Rule #2, 14.1%), the consistency of the search coverage and reference space (Rule #4, 13.8%), and the statistical threshold (Rule #8, 10.2%). Overall, 63 quotations from 51 papers contained some errors. In other words, 7.8% (63/804) of the quotations contained errors and they involved 13.3% (51/384) of the papers. The commonest quotation errors were dealing with a failure to substantiate the assertion, unrelated to the assertion, and oversimplification of the original notion. Some notable quotation error examples were to quote Müller et al. to substantiate the assertion of having at least 10 datasets to be considered to have adequate power for ES-SDM meta-analysis (no such recommendation), and having a misquoted primary cluster-forming threshold of p < 0.05 or p < 0.005 (should be p < 0.001). The neuroscience community should be cautious and double-check the accuracy of assertions, even with a quotation.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,This work was supported by departmental funds only.,NeuroImage Clinical,,,Humans; Neuroimaging; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Meta-Analysis as Topic,2023-08-16,2023,2023-08-16,2023,39,,103496,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yeung, Andy Wai Kan","Yeung, Andy Wai Kan (Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, Applied Oral Sciences and Community Dental Care, Faculty of Dentistry, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China)",,"Yeung, Andy Wai Kan (University of Hong Kong)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2023.103496,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163318981,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,

In this piece, authored and edited by a diverse group of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) scholars, we present 10 simple rules for succeeding as an underrepresented STEM undergraduate student, illuminating the ""hidden curriculum"" of STEM specifically as it relates to the underrepresented undergraduate experience. Our rules begin by encouraging students to embrace their own distinct identities and scientific voices and explain how students can overcome challenges unique to underrepresented students throughout their undergraduate degrees. These rules are derived from a combination of our own experiences navigating our undergraduate STEM degrees and the growing body of literature on improving success for underrepresented students.","We are indebted to our inspiring colleagues who contributed their views and critique to early drafts of this piece.

Representing biomedical knowledge in a machine-interpretable, computable form increases its ability to be discovered, accessed, understood, and deployed. Computable knowledge artifacts can greatly advance the potential for implementation, reproducibility, or extension of the knowledge by users, who may include practitioners, researchers, and learners. Enriching computable knowledge artifacts may help facilitate reuse and translation into practice. Following the examples of 10 Simple Rules papers for scientific code, software, and applications, we present 10 Simple Rules intended to make shared computable knowledge artifacts more useful and reusable. These rules are mainly for researchers and their teams who have decided that sharing their computable knowledge is important, who wish to go beyond simply describing results, algorithms, or models via traditional publication pathways, and who want to both make their research findings more accessible, and to help others use their computable knowledge.

Active efforts in recent years to bring more diversity to academic events have brought progress and created momentum. However, we must reflect on these efforts and determine which underrepresented groups are being disadvantaged. Inclusion at academic events is important to ensure diversity of discourse and opinion, to help build networks, and to avoid academic siloing. All of these contribute to the development of a robust and resilient academic field. We have developed these Ten Simple Rules both to amplify the voices that have been speaking out and to celebrate the progress of many Equity, Diversity, and Inclusivity practices that continue to drive the organisation of academic events. The Rules aim to raise awareness as well as provide actionable suggestions and tools to support these initiatives further. This aims to support academic organisations such as the Deep Learning Indaba, Neuromatch Academy, the IBRO-Simons Computational Neuroscience Imbizo, Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG), Arabs in Neuroscience, FAIRPoints, and OLS (formerly Open Life Science). This article is a call to action for organisers to reevaluate the impact and reach of their inclusive practices.","We would like to recognise the feedback and ideas shared with us by all attendees during the focus groups that contributed to the development of this paper.

Training is often organized on a grassroots level, offered by early career researchers, for early career researchers. Buffet style courses that cover many topics can inspire participants to try new things; however, they can also be overwhelming. Participants who want to implement new practices may not know where to start once they return to their research team. We describe ten simple rules to guide participants of relevant training courses in implementing robust research practices in their own projects, once they return to their research group. This includes (1) prioritizing and planning which practices to implement, which involves obtaining support and convincing others involved in the research project of the added value of implementing new practices; (2) managing problems that arise during implementation; and (3) making reproducible research and open science practices an integral part of a future research career. We also outline strategies that course organizers can use to prepare participants for implementation and support them during this process.",,"CH and TLW were funded via the SPOKES Subproject of the Wellcome Trust Translational Partnership at Charité and Berlin Institutes of Health (218358/Z/19/Z).

Unlike pure metals, single-atom alloys escape the well-established conceptual framework developed nearly three decades ago for predicting catalytic performance. Although this offers the opportunity to explore so far unattainable chemistries, this leaves us without a simple guide for the design of single-atom alloys able to catalyse targeted reactions. Here, based on thousands of density functional theory calculations, we reveal a 10-electron count rule for the binding of adsorbates on the dopant atoms, usually the active sites, of single-atom alloy surfaces. A simple molecular orbital approach rationalizes this rule and the nature of the adsorbate–dopant interaction. In addition, our intuitive model can accelerate the rational design of single-atom alloy catalysts. Indeed, we illustrate how the unique insights provided by the electron count rule help identify the most promising dopant for an industrially relevant hydrogenation reaction, thereby reducing the number of potential materials by more than one order of magnitude.","We thank E.

Each feature category was analyzed for interobserver agreement using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for ordinal variables and free marginal kappa for nominal variables. The two-tailed significance level (a) was set at 0.05.ResultsFor IOTA simple rules, interobserver agreement was almost perfect for three malignant lesion categories (M2-4) and substantial for the remaining two (M1, M5) with k-values of 0.80–0.82 and 0.68–0.69, respectively. Interobserver agreement was almost perfect for two benign feature categories (B2, B3), substantial for two (B4, B5) and moderate for one (B1) with k-values of 0.81–0.90, 0.69–0.70 and 0.60, respectively. For O-RADS, interobserver agreement was almost perfect for two out of ten feature categories (ascites and peritoneal nodules) with k-values of 0.89 and 0.97. Interobserver agreement ranged from fair to substantial for the remaining eight feature categories with k-values of 0.39–0.61. Fellows and attendings had ICC values of 0.725 and 0.517, respectively.ConclusionO-RADS had variable interobserver agreement with overall good agreement.

One of the main causes of career abandonment by women is maternity, with many women leaving Academia after having their first child because of the career penalties associated with motherhood. Thus, more actions to help scientific moms to balance family and academic work are urgently needed to increase representation of women and other gender discriminated people in Academia. Besides mothers, these rules may also benefit other groups such as mothers-to-be, fathers, caregivers, and women in general. Increasing women representation in science, including mothers, is critical because equality is a fundamental right, and because more diverse working environments are more productive and get to more optimal solutions. Here, we describe 10 simple rules that can be adopted in Academia to halt the abandonment of scientific careers by women after motherhood. We strongly encourage their implementation to increase gender diversity and equality in science.",We would like to thank J.P. Lessard and J.

However, studies can also indirectly inflict harm on individuals and social groups through how they are designed, reported, and disseminated. As evidenced by recent criticisms and retractions of high-profile studies dealing with a wide variety of social issues, there is a scarcity of resources and guidance on how one can conduct research in a socially responsible manner. As such, even motivated researchers might publish work that has negative social impacts due to a lack of awareness.

These rules, which cover major considerations throughout the life cycle of a study from inception to dissemination, are not aimed as a prescriptive list or a deterministic code of conduct. Rather, they are meant to help motivated scientists to reflect on their social responsibility as researchers and actively engage with the potential social impact of their research.","We would like to thank Sara Chadwick, Tal Eyal, Alex Holcombe, Mustafa I.

However, at our university (San Francisco State University), until recently, almost no biology, biochemistry, and chemistry students (from here bio/chem students) completed a minor in computer science. To change this, a new minor in computing applications, which is informally known as the Promoting Inclusivity in Computing (PINC) minor, was established in 2016. Here, we present the lessons we learned from our experience in a set of 10 rules. The first 3 rules focus on setting up the program so that it interests students in biology, chemistry, and biochemistry. Rules 4 through 8 focus on how the classes of the program are taught to make them interesting for our students and to provide the students with the support they need.

By fitting models to experimental data we can probe the algorithms underlying behavior, find neural correlates of computational variables and better understand the effects of drugs, illness and interventions. But with great power comes great responsibility. Here, we offer ten simple rules to ensure that computational modeling is used with care and yields meaningful insights. In particular, we present a beginner-friendly, pragmatic and details-oriented introduction on how to relate models to data. What, exactly, can a model tell us about the mind? To answer this, we apply our rules to the simplest modeling techniques most accessible to beginning modelers and illustrate them with examples and code available online. However, most rules apply to more advanced techniques. Our hope is that by following our guidelines, researchers will avoid many pitfalls and unleash the power of computational modeling on their own data.","The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

These immersive experiences can dramatically improve retention and completion rates, especially for students from traditionally underserved populations in STEM disciplines. Scientists typically do not receive any formal training in management or group dynamics before taking on the role of a lab head. Thus, peer forums and shared wisdom are crucial for developing the vision and skills involved with mentorship and leading a successful research lab. Faculty at any institution can help improve student outcomes and the success of their labs by thoughtfully including undergraduates in their research programs. Moreover, faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions have special challenges that are not often acknowledged or addressed in public discussions about best practices for running a lab. Here, we present 10 simple rules for fostering a successful undergraduate research lab.

METHODS: In a multicenter study involving nine centers consecutive patients with persistent adnexal tumors underwent transvaginal gray-scale and Doppler ultrasound examination using a standardized examination technique and standardized terms and definitions. Information on 42 gray-scale ultrasound variables and six Doppler variables was collected and entered into a research protocol. When developing simple ultrasound-based rules to predict malignancy (M-rules) we chose the ultrasound variable or the combination of ultrasound variables that had the highest positive predictive value (PPV) with regard to malignancy; when developing simple rules to predict a benign tumor (B-rules) we chose the ultrasound variable or the combination of ultrasound variables that had the lowest PPV with regard to malignancy. We selected ten rules that were in agreement with our clinical experience and were applicable to at least 30 tumors and then tested them prospectively on 507 tumors examined in three of the nine centers.
RESULTS: 1066 patients with 1233 adnexal tumors were included. There were 903 benign tumors (73%) and 330 malignant tumors (27%). In 167 patients the tumors were bilateral. We selected five simple rules to predict malignancy (M-rules): (1) irregular solid tumor; (2) ascites; (3) at least four papillary structures; (4) irregular multilocular-solid tumor with a largest diameter of at least 100 mm; and (5) very high color content on color Doppler examination. We chose five simple rules to suggest a benign tumor (B-rules): (1) unilocular cyst; (2) presence of solid components where the largest solid component is < 7 mm in largest diameter; (3) acoustic shadows; (4) smooth multilocular tumor less than 100 mm in largest diameter; and (5) no detectable blood flow on Doppler examination. These ten rules were applicable to 76% of all tumors, where they resulted in a sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 90%, positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 9.45 and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.08. When prospectively tested the rules were applicable in 76% (386/507) of the tumors, where they had a sensitivity of 95% (106/112), a specificity of 91% (249/274), LR+ of 10.37, and LR- of 0.06.
CONCLUSION: Most adnexal tumors in an ordinary tumor population can be correctly classified as benign or malignant using simple ultrasound-based rules. For tumors that cannot be classified using simple rules, ultrasound examination by an expert examiner might be useful.","This research was supported by GOA‐AMBioRICS, CoE EF/05/006, Belgian network DYSCO, BIOPATTERN (FP6‐2002‐IST 508803), ETUMOUR (FP6‐2002‐LIFESCIHEALTH 503094); by the Swedish Medical Research Council (grants nos.

Various pathways may be followed to publish the FAIR vocabulary, but we emphasise particularly the goal of providing a globally unique resolvable identifier for each term or concept. A standard representation of the concept should be returned when the individual web identifier is resolved, using SKOS or OWL serialised in an RDF-based representation for machine-interchange and in a web-page for human consumption. Guidelines for vocabulary and term metadata are provided, as well as development and maintenance considerations. The rules are arranged as a stepwise recipe for creating a FAIR vocabulary based on the legacy vocabulary. By following these rules you can achieve the outcome of converting a legacy vocabulary into a standalone FAIR vocabulary, which can be used for unambiguous data annotation. In turn, this increases data interoperability and enables data integration.","The contribution of SJDC was supported through a CSIRO Strategic Project for engagement with CODATA.

Ten methods of allometric scaling were used to predict human clearance of biliary excreted drugs from animal data. The methods included the simple allometric approach; the rule of exponents; the rule of exponents with a correction factor; the ratio of human and monkey liver blood flow x monkey clearance; product of clearance and bile flow; product of clearance and UDGPT; product of clearance, bile flow, and UDGPT; and a modified version of the last three approaches in association with the rule of exponents. The results of the study indicate that among these ten approaches, the rule of exponents with the correction factor is the best approach for the prediction of human clearance for drugs which are excreted in the bile. The worst approach is the product of clearance, bile flow, and UDGPT. The simple allometry and the monkey liver blood flow (MLBF) approaches gave almost similar results.

The area of infectious diseases stands somewhat apart from other human diseases insofar as the relevant genomic data comes from the microbes rather than their human hosts. A particular concern about the threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has driven the collection and reporting of large-scale datasets containing information from microbial genomes together with antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) results. Unfortunately, the lack of clear standards or guiding principles for the reporting of such data is hampering the field's advancement. We therefore present our recommendations for the publication and sharing of genotype and phenotype data on AMR, in the form of 10 simple rules. The adoption of these recommendations will enhance AMR data interoperability and help enable its large-scale analyses using computational biology tools, including mathematical modelling and machine learning. We hope that these rules can shed light on often overlooked but nonetheless very necessary aspects of AMR data sharing and enhance the field's ability to address the problems of understanding AMR mechanisms, tracking their emergence and spread in populations, and predicting microbial susceptibility to antimicrobials for diagnostic purposes.",,"LC acknowledges funding from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis (reference MR/R015600/1), jointly funded by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) and the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), under the MRC/FCDO Concordat agreement and is also part of the EDCTP2 programme supported by the European Union.

In this paper, we describe ten simple rules for planning, implementing, and evaluating teacher engagement to support the broader impact goals of your research project. These collaborations can lead to the development of instructional materials or activities for students in the classroom or provide science research opportunities for teachers. We share our successes and lessons learned while collaborating with high school biology teachers to create technology-based, instructional materials developed from basic biological research. The rules we describe are applicable across teacher partnerships at any grade level in that they emphasize eliciting and respecting teachers' professionalism and expertise.","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1620746 to PJTW and LSM and Grant No. 1620910 to FR.

REUs provide guided mentorship and learning experiences in a summer-long program where students develop research skills, build scientific knowledge, and strengthen their scientific identity. While the benefits of REUs are abundant, the process is not always easy to navigate, especially for students who come from first-generation and/or low-income (FLI) backgrounds. This paper provides two-fold guidance for undergraduate students interested in participating in REUs. Rules 1 to 5 focus on demystifying the application process from beginning to end, and Rules 6 to 10 guide students who are on the other side of the application process. Thus, this paper will be most helpful for undergraduate students who are either considering applying for an REU or have been accepted into one and want to learn more about what to expect. It can also be a shareable resource for faculty, staff, and mentors who work directly with STEM undergraduates.","We thank Gabriella Castillo for their creative talents and collaboration in developing Fig 1.

The events of 2020 ignited global attention to systemic racism and racial inequalities, including the lack of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the academy and especially in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) fields. Racial and ethnic diversity in graduate programs in particular warrants special attention as graduate students of color report experiencing alarming rates of racism, discrimination, microaggressions, and other exclusionary behaviors. As part of the Graduate Dean's Advisory Council on Diversity (GDACD) at the University of California Merced, the authors of this manuscript held a year-long discussion on these issues and ways to take meaningful action to address these persistent issues of injustices. We have outlined 10 rules to help graduate programs develop antiracist practices to promote racial and ethnic justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI) in the academy. We focus on efforts to address systemic causes of the underrepresentation and attrition of students from minoritized communities.

Predictive modeling approaches that define and validate models with independent datasets offer a solution to this problem. While these methods can detect novel and generalizable brain-behavior associations, they can be daunting, which has limited their use by the wider connectivity community. Here, we offer practical advice and examples based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) functional connectivity data for implementing these approaches.

Due to their band-gaps, they can act as filters in both temporal and spatial domains. However, in most cases, due to their physical symmetry, their angular responses are symmetrical. Here, a structure based on a 1D photonic crystal is introduced and analyzed, which has an asymmetric angular selectivity. The structure is analyzed using the plane wave expansion method. The properties of the structure are expressed and verified by a commercial full-wave simulator software. Based on the analysis and its results, some simple design rules are derived. By using the extracted rules and some approximations, the potential of the structure to be used in radiative coolers, which are not completely toward the sky, is introduced. It is shown that if the structure is used as windows in buildings, it can save up to tens of watts per square meter in energy consumption for air conditioning. Finally, the whole structure including the radiative cooler is simulated, and the results support the calculations and approximations.",,,Optics Express,,,,2024-01-30,2024,2024-01-30,2024-02-12,32,4,5191-5205,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bahramipour, Siavash Shahriar; Askarpour, Amir Nader","Bahramipour, Siavash Shahriar (Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)); Askarpour, Amir Nader (Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic))",,"Bahramipour, Siavash Shahriar (Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)); Askarpour, Amir Nader (Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic))",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1364/oe.509800,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167846843,51 Physical Sciences; 5103 Classical Physics,

With the advancement of the internet and social networks, communication has become rapid and sometimes overwhelming, especially in science. It is important to provide scientists with useful, effective, and dynamic tools to establish and build a fluid communication framework that allows for scientific advancement. Therefore, in this article, we present advice and recommendations that can help promote and improve science communication while respecting an adequate balance in the degree of commitment toward collaborative work. We have developed 10 rules shown in increasing order of commitment that are grouped into 3 key categories: (1) speak (based on active participation); (2) join (based on joining scientific groups); and (3) assess (based on the analysis and retrospective consideration of the weaknesses and strengths). We include examples and resources that provide actionable strategies for involvement and engagement with science communication, from basic steps to more advanced, introspective, and long-term commitments. Overall, we aim to help spread science from within and encourage and engage scientists to become involved in science communication effectively and dynamically.","While preparing this manuscript, we obtained constructive feedback from many members of the Communication and Outreach Subcommittee of the Genetics Society of America who participate in the Early Career Leadership Program.

DESIGN: Patients with steady-state PHT plasma concentrations at least two different PHT doses were identified from three separate sources of patient data. A computerized dosing program calculated pharmacokinetic parameters using Bayesian methodology, then predicted how many patients were likely to reach potentially toxic PHT plasma concentrations when their daily dosage was increased by 30, 50, or 100 mg. Dosing rules were developed to allow fewer than ten percent of resultant plasma concentrations to exceed 25 micrograms/mL. The dosing rules then were tested on dose/plasma concentration data from a separate group of patients.
SETTING: All patients were being treated by neurologists either as outpatients or inpatients.
PATIENTS: All patients were adults with epilepsy being treated with PHT; none had clinically significant renal or hepatic disease. Patients for the computer simulation were from three sources: (1) patients who had an initial PHT plasma concentration < 10 micrograms/mL and required a dosage increase; (2) patients admitted to the hospital for PHT intoxication; and (3) patients who required consultations specifically for PHT dosing. Patients on whom the dosing rules were tested were part of a prospective, randomized trial of antiepileptic drug safety and efficacy.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Successful dosing rules allowing fewer than ten percent of resulting plasma concentrations in the test group to exceed 25 micrograms/mL.
RESULTS: The simulations used 167 actual dose/plasma concentration pairs from 45 patients. The resulting dosing rules were: increase the dosage by 100 mg/d if the initial plasma concentration was < 7 micrograms/mL; increase the dosage by 50 mg/d if the initial plasma concentration is 7 to < 12 micrograms/mL; increase the dosage by 30 mg/d if the initial plasma concentration is > or = 12 micrograms/mL. The rules were tested on 129 50- or 100-mg dosage increases in 77 patients. All 53 dosage increases that were within the dosing rules produced plasma concentrations < 25 micrograms/mL, whereas 36 percent (27 of 74) of the dosage increases that exceeded the dosing rules produced plasma concentrations > 25 micrograms/mL.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed dosing rules are a simple method for clinicians to estimate PHT dosage changes and appear to be safe and accurate when applied retrospectively to actual patient data.",,,Annals of Pharmacotherapy,,,"Adult; Computer Simulation; Drug Therapy, Computer-Assisted; Epilepsy; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Phenytoin; Prospective Studies",1993-10,1993,2016-06-28,1993-10,27,10,1169-1173,Closed,Article,"Privitera, M D","Privitera, M D (Department of Neurology, University of Cincinnati Medical Center, OH.)","Privitera, M D (University of Cincinnati Medical Center)","Privitera, M D (University of Cincinnati Medical Center)",16,0,0.65,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1009087424,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,

                  There are several reasons for forming an aging international research collaboration; however, creating a successful and productive research team during the global crisis may require extensive planning and efforts. Our team consists of ten scholars from five countries, including Hong Kong, Nepal, Singapore, Thailand, and the United States. To accomplish this initiative, we employ ten simple rules for establishing international research collaborations proposed by R. de Grijs (2015). We aim to examine impacts of the pandemic on physical activity, frailty, falls, depression and social networks in diverse older adults. We collect data by online survey and/or face-to –face survey using questionnaires including fear of the COVID, face mask use, Social Network, Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity, a simple frailty questionnaire, CDC fall risk checklist, short Fall-Efficacy Scale International and Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Topics of discussion included: research progression, lessons learned and barriers to international collaboration during the COVID-19 crisis.",,,Innovation in Aging,,,,2021-12-17,2021,2021-12-17,2021-12-17,5,Supplement_1,142-142,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chong, Wayne; Kwan, Rick; Roopsawang, Inthira; Gautam, Ramraj; Vivian, W Q Lou; Thiamwong, Ladda","Chong, Wayne (Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Not Applicable, Singapore); Kwan, Rick (The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Hong Kong); Roopsawang, Inthira (Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand); Gautam, Ramraj (UMass Lowell, Lowell, Massachusetts, United States); Vivian, W Q Lou (The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Not Applicable, Hong Kong); Thiamwong, Ladda (College of Nursing, University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida, United States)",,"Chong, Wayne (Nanyang Technological University); Kwan, Rick (Hong Kong Polytechnic University); Roopsawang, Inthira (Mahidol University); Gautam, Ramraj (University of Massachusetts Lowell); Vivian, W Q Lou (University of Hong Kong); Thiamwong, Ladda (University of Central Florida)",0,0,,0.0,https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/5/Supplement_1/141/43179605/igab046.544.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143977892,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

In a scholarly context, the main drivers for using these containers are transparency and support of reproducibility; in turn, a workflow's reproducibility can be greatly affected by the choices that are made with respect to building containers. In many cases, the build process for the container's image is created from instructions provided in a Dockerfile format. In support of this approach, we present a set of rules to help researchers write understandable Dockerfiles for typical data science workflows. By following the rules in this article, researchers can create containers suitable for sharing with fellow scientists, for including in scholarly communication such as education or scientific papers, and for effective and sustainable personal workflows.","The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

In funded research projects and other research endeavours, workshops are the mechanism used to gather the wider project, community, or interested people together around a particular topic. However, natural questions arise: how do we measure the impact of these workshops? Do we know whether they are meeting the goals and objectives we set for them? What indicators should we use? In response to these questions, this paper will outline rules that will improve the measurement of the impact of workshops.","SS, AN, RS, IE, and OP acknowledge the support of EPSRC, BBSRC and ESRC Grant EP/N006410/1 for the UK Software Sustainability Institute, http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/N006410/1.

By a simple model mainly based on spatial attraction and matching growth mechanisms, we reveal that the spatial scaling rules of these three elements are in a consistent framework, which allows us to use any single observation to infer the others. All numerical and theoretical results are consistent with empirical data from ten representative cities. In addition, our model can also provide a general explanation of the origins of the universal super- and sub-linear aggregate scaling laws and accurately predict kilometre-level socioeconomic activity. Our work opens a new avenue for uncovering the evolution of cities in terms of the interplay among urban elements, and it has a broad range of applications.","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 61673070, 61773069, 71731002 and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities with the Grant No. 2015KJJCB13, and also partially supported by NSF Grants PHY-1505000, CMMI-1125290, CHE-1213217, DTRA Grant HDTRA1-14-1-0017, DOE Grant DE-AC07-05Id14517.

It has been demonstrated that one of the STDP learning rules is suited for learning spatiotemporal patterns. When multiple neurons are organized in a simple competitive spiking neural network, this network is capable of learning multiple distinct patterns. If patterns overlap significantly (i.e., patterns are mutually inclusive), however, competition would not preclude trained neuron's responding to a new pattern and adjusting synaptic weights accordingly. This letter presents a simple neural network that combines vertical inhibition and Euclidean distance-dependent synaptic strength factor. This approach helps to solve the problem of pattern size-dependent parameter optimality and significantly reduces the probability of a neuron's forgetting an already learned pattern. For demonstration purposes, the network was trained for the first ten letters of the Braille alphabet.",,,Neural Computation,,,"Action Potentials; Animals; Computer Simulation; Learning; Models, Neurological; Neuronal Plasticity; Neurons; Synaptic Transmission; Time Factors",2015-06-16,2015,2015-06-16,2015-08,27,8,1673-1685,Closed,Article,"Krunglevicius, Dalius","Krunglevicius, Dalius (Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Vilnius University, Vilnius, LT-03225, Lithuania, dalius.krunglevicius@gmail.com)",,"Krunglevicius, Dalius (Vilnius University)",5,0,0.07,1.04,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007470996,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

The obtained results allowed the authors to estimate the repeatability and reproducibility of the tensile adhesion strength measurement method using the methodology following ISO 5725-2:1994+AC1:2002. Standard deviations of repeatability ranging from 0.09 to 0.15 for the general means value in the range of 0.89-1.76 MPa and standard deviations of reproducibility ranging from 0.14 to 0.21 for the same general means content indicate that the accuracy of tensile adhesion strength measurement method is not high enough. From the group of ten operators, five perform tensile adhesion strength measurements daily, the remaining five perform other measures, and the results obtained by professionals and non-professionals showed no significant differences. In light of the obtained results, compliance assessment with this method with the criteria set out in the harmonized standard EN 12004:2007+A1:2012 carried out by different operators may be divergent, and there is a significant risk of incorrect assessments.

We screen highly discriminative genes and gene pairs to create simple prediction models involved in single genes or gene pairs on the basis of soft computing approach and rough set theory. Accurate cancerous prediction is obtained when we apply the simple prediction models for four cancerous gene expression datasets: CNS tumor, colon tumor, lung cancer and DLBCL. Some genes closely correlated with the pathogenesis of specific or general cancers are identified. In contrast with other models, our models are simple, effective and robust. Meanwhile, our models are interpretable for they are based on decision rules. Our results demonstrate that very simple models may perform well on cancerous molecular prediction and important gene markers of cancer can be detected if the gene selection approach is chosen reasonably.","This work was partly supported by KAKENHI (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research) on Priority Areas “comparative genomics” from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.",,Cancer Informatics,,,,2009-01,2009,2009-05-26,2009-01,7,,cin.s2655,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wang, Xiaosheng; Gotoh, Osamu","Wang, Xiaosheng (Department of Intelligence Science and Technology, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.); Gotoh, Osamu (Department of Intelligence Science and Technology, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.; National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Computational Biology Research Center, Tokyo 135-0064, Japan.)","Wang, Xiaosheng (Kyoto University)","Wang, Xiaosheng (Kyoto University); Gotoh, Osamu (Kyoto University; National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology)",36,4,0.35,4.97,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.4137/CIN.S2655,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1077950820,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

In such studies, sequence annotations frequently play an essential role, and reliable results depend on metadata quality. However, the semantic heterogeneity and annotation inconsistencies in biological databases greatly increase the complexity of aggregating and cleaning metadata. Manual curation of datasets, traditionally favoured by life scientists, is impractical for studies involving thousands of records. In this study, we investigate quality issues that affect major public databases, and quantify the effectiveness of an automated metadata extraction approach that combines structural and semantic rules. We applied this approach to more than 90,000 influenza A records, to annotate sequences with protein name, virus subtype, isolate, host, geographic origin, and year of isolation.ResultsOver 40,000 annotated Influenza A protein sequences were collected by combining information from more than 90,000 documents from NCBI public databases. Metadata values were automatically extracted, aggregated and reconciled from several document fields by applying user-defined structural rules. For each property, values were recovered from ≥88.8% of records, with accuracy exceeding 96% in most cases. Because of semantic heterogeneity, each property required up to six different structural rules to be combined. Significant quality differences between databases were found: GenBank documents yield values more reliably than documents extracted from GenPept. Using a simple set of semantic rules and a reasoner, we reconstructed relationships between sequences from the same isolate, thus identifying 7640 isolates. Validation of isolate metadata against a simple ontology highlighted more than 400 inconsistencies, leading to over 3,000 property value corrections.ConclusionTo overcome the quality issues inherent in public databases, automated knowledge aggregation with embedded intelligence is needed for large-scale analyses. Our results show that user-controlled intuitive approaches, based on combination of simple rules, can reliably automate various curation tasks, reducing the need for manual corrections to approximately 5% of the records. Emerging semantic technologies possess desirable features to support today's knowledge aggregation tasks, with a potential to bring immediate benefits to this field.","The authors thank A. T.

Severe pneumonia was identified by two or more of the following: confusion; respiratory rate > or = 30/min; diastolic blood pressure < or = 60 mmHg; urea >7 mmol/l. One hundred patients (mean age 58.8 years) were included; 32 satisfied the rule. Seven died, all of whom satisfied the rule. Ten patients received intensive care, including six who died.

However, synapses being subject to STDP rules are readily influenced in noisy circumstances because synaptic conductances are modified by pre- and postsynaptic spikes elicited within a few tens of milliseconds, regardless of whether those spikes convey information or not. Noisy firing existing everywhere in the brain may induce irrelevant enhancement of synaptic connections through STDP rules and would result in uncertain memory encoding and obscure memory patterns. We will here show that the LTD windows of the STDP rules enable robust sequence learning amid background noise in cooperation with a large signal transmission delay between neurons and a theta rhythm, using a network model of the entorhinal cortex layer II with entorhinal-hippocampal loop connections. The important element of the present model for robust sequence learning amid background noise is the symmetric STDP rule having LTD windows on both sides of the LTP window, in addition to the loop connections having a large signal transmission delay and the theta rhythm pacing activities of stellate cells. Above all, the LTD window in the range of positive spike-timing is important to prevent influences of noise with the progress of sequence learning.","The authors are grateful to Dr. Katsumi Tateno and Dr. Motoharu Yoshida for valuable comments on the manuscript.

Since then, many countries have been forced to suspend public gatherings, leading to many conference cancellations, postponements, or reorganizations. Switching from a face-to-face to a remote conference became inevitable and the ultimate solution to sustain scientific exchanges at the national and the international levels. The same year, as a committee, we were in charge of organizing the major French annual conference that covers all computational biology areas: The ""Journées Ouvertes en Biologie, Informatique et Mathématiques"" (JOBIM). Despite the health crisis, we succeeded in changing the conference format from face to face to remote in a very short amount of time. Here, we propose 10 simple rules based on this experience to modify a conference format in an optimized and cost-effective way. In addition to the suggested rules, we decided to emphasize an unexpected benefit of this situation: a significant reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to travel for scientific conference attendance. We believe that even once the SARS-CoV-2 crisis is over, we collectively will have an opportunity to think about the way we approach such scientific events over the longer term.","The authors received no specific funding for this work.

Based on these models, charts of mortality and morbidity are drawn and compared with common charts of birthweight centiles. Classification rules for newborns at risk are defined by iso-mortality contours, marginal birthweight centiles, and birthweight centiles adjusted by gestational age, respectively, and compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The results suggest that, as far as neonatal mortality is concerned, classification rules based on simple marginal birthweight centiles perform almost as well as iso-mortality contours and considerably better than birthweight centiles adjusted for gestational age.",,,Statistics in Medicine,,,"Apgar Score; Birth Weight; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Female; Gestational Age; Health Status; Humans; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Logistic Models; Male; Models, Statistical; Morbidity; ROC Curve; Reproducibility of Results; Statistics, Nonparametric",1995-10-30,1995,2007-02-28,1995-10-30,14,20,2191-2204,Closed,Article,"Ritter, C.; Bouckaert, A.; van Lierde, M.; Theunissen, I.","Ritter, C.

No lab team can be prepared for something like a pandemic such as COVID-19, which has led to shuttered labs around the globe. But many other types of crises can also arise that labs may have to weather during their lifetime. What can researchers do to make a lab more resilient in the face of such exterior forces? What systems or behaviors could we adjust in 'normal' times that promote lab success, and increase the chances that the lab will stay on its trajectory? We offer 10 rules, based on our current experiences as a lab group adapting to crisis.","The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Ten pediatric emergency departments.
PARTICIPANTS: Children and adolescents aged 3 to 18 years who presented with suspected appendicitis from March 1, 2009, through April 30, 2010.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The test performance of the Low-Risk Appendicitis Rule.
RESULTS: Among 2625 patients enrolled, 1018 (38.8% [95% CI, 36.9%-40.7%]) had appendicitis. Validation of the rule resulted in a sensitivity of 95.5% (95% CI, 93.9%-96.7%), specificity of 36.3% (33.9%-38.9%), and negative predictive value of 92.7% (90.1%-94.6%). Theoretical application would have identified 573 (24.0%) as being at low risk, misclassifying 42 patients (4.5% [95% CI, 3.4%-6.1%]) with appendicitis. We refined the prediction rule, resulting in a model that identified patients at low risk with (1) an absolute neutrophil count of 6.75 × 103/μL or less and no maximal tenderness in the right lower quadrant or (2) an absolute neutrophil count of 6.75 × 103/μL or less with maximal tenderness in the right lower quadrant but no abdominal pain with walking/jumping or coughing. This refined rule had a sensitivity of 98.1% (95% CI, 97.0%-98.9%), specificity of 23.7% (21.7%-25.9%), and negative predictive value of 95.3% (92.3%-97.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: We have validated and refined a simple clinical prediction rule for pediatric appendicitis. For patients identified as being at low risk, clinicians should consider alternative strategies, such as observation or ultrasonographic examination, rather than proceeding to immediate computed tomographic imaging.","Funding/Support: This study was supported by grant UL1 RR024156 from the National Center for Research Resources, a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and NIH Roadmap for Medical Research.

Feature selection is often used to address this problem by selecting informative genes from among thousands or tens of thousands of genes. However, most of the existing methods of microarray-based cancer classification utilize too many genes to achieve accurate classification, which often hampers the interpretability of the models. For a better understanding of the classification results, it is desirable to develop simpler rule-based models with as few marker genes as possible.MethodsWe screened a small number of informative single genes and gene pairs on the basis of their depended degrees proposed in rough sets. Applying the decision rules induced by the selected genes or gene pairs, we constructed cancer classifiers. We tested the efficacy of the classifiers by leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) of training sets and classification of independent test sets.ResultsWe applied our methods to five cancerous gene expression datasets: leukemia (acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL] vs. acute myeloid leukemia [AML]), lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and leukemia (ALL vs. mixed-lineage leukemia [MLL] vs. AML). Accurate classification outcomes were obtained by utilizing just one or two genes. Some genes that correlated closely with the pathogenesis of relevant cancers were identified. In terms of both classification performance and algorithm simplicity, our approach outperformed or at least matched existing methods.ConclusionIn cancerous gene expression datasets, a small number of genes, even one or two if selected correctly, is capable of achieving an ideal cancer classification effect. This finding also means that very simple rules may perform well for cancerous class prediction.","We would like to thank our colleagues, Dr. T. Yada, Dr. N. Ichinose, Dr. S.

In particular, in an atmosphere far from radioactive equilibrium, such as a working area in a mine close to a source of radon and supplied with fresh air, the unattached fraction can be a factor of ten or more greater than indicated by a simple particle concentration measurement.

Goodbye to the simple solutions: the second phase of priority setting in health care. British Medical Journal 1998;317:1000-7]. Whilst attending the 2nd International Conference on Priorities in Health Care in London, Holm argued that the search for a rational set of decision-making rules was no longer adequate. Instead, the priority setting process itself was now thought to be more complex. Ten years later, the Conference returns to the UK for the first time, and it is timely to describe some new tools intended to assist both researchers and decision-makers seeking to develop both rational and fair and legitimate priority setting processes. In this paper we argue that to do so, researchers and decision-makers need to adopt an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to priority setting. We focus on program budgeting and marginal analysis (PBMA) and bring together three hitherto separate interdisciplinary strands of the PBMA literature. Our aim is to assist researchers and decision-makers seeking to effectively develop and implement PBMA in practice. Specifically, we focus on the use of multi-criteria decision analysis, participatory action research, and accountability for reasonableness, drawn from the disciplines of decision analysis, sociology, and ethics respectively.","AcknowledgementsStuart Peacock and Craig Mitton are Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research Scholars.

Undergraduate research experiences remain very limited at SFSU and elsewhere, so the summer program provides opportunities for many more students beyond the mentoring capacity of our university laboratories. In addition, we were concerned that many students from historically underrepresented (HU) groups may be unable to take advantage of traditional summer research programs because these programs require students to relocate or be available full time, which is not feasible for students who have family, work, or housing commitments. Our program, which is local and part-time, serves about 5 times as many students as a typical National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program, on a smaller budget. Based on our experiences, we present 10 simple rules for busy faculty who want to create similar programs to engage non-CS HU undergraduates in computational research. Note that while some of the strategies we implement are based on evidence-based publications in the social sciences or education research literature, the original suggestions we make here are based on our trial-and-error experiences, rather than formal hypothesis testing.","PSP, MMB, FLC, VRC, BC, SH, JJ, CO, SM, RR, and NA were supported by NIH grant R25MD011714, and PSP, RR, and NA were supported by NSF IUSE grant 1821422.

The field of biology is no exception; but most biologists receive little or no formal preparation for the increasingly computational aspects of their discipline. In consequence, informal training courses are often needed to plug the gaps; and the demand for such training is growing worldwide. To meet this demand, some training programs are being expanded, and new ones are being developed. Key to both scenarios is the creation of new course materials. Rather than starting from scratch, however, it's sometimes possible to repurpose materials that already exist. Yet finding suitable materials online can be difficult: They're often widely scattered across the internet or hidden in their home institutions, with no systematic way to find them. This is a common problem for all digital objects. The scientific community has attempted to address this issue by developing a set of rules (which have been called the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable [FAIR] principles) to make such objects more findable and reusable. Here, we show how to apply these rules to help make training materials easier to find, (re)use, and adapt, for the benefit of all.",The authors received no specific funding for this work.

These are the opinions of the authors, two pediatric radiologists with special interest in chest imaging and 50 years combined experience in working with clinical colleagues to provide the best imaging care for their patients.

Nowadays, stakeholder engagement is of fundamental importance to project success and achieving the expected impact and is often mandatory in a third-party funding context. Ultimately, research and development can only be successful if people react positively to the results and benefits generated by a project. For the wider acceptance of research outcomes, it is therefore essential that the public is made aware of and has an opportunity to discuss the results of research undertaken through two-way communication (interpersonal communication) with researchers. Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), an approach that anticipates and assesses potential implications and societal expectations regarding research and innovation, aims to foster inclusive and sustainable research and innovation. Research and innovation processes need to become more responsive and adaptive to these grand challenges. This implies, among other things, the introduction of broader foresight and impact assessments for new technologies beyond their anticipated market benefits and risks. Therefore, this article provides a structured workflow that explains ""how to develop a stakeholder engagement plan"" step by step.",We thank our CHARME community [23] and OXIPRO partners [24] for the useful discussions about the topic leading to write this publication.

Especially in forensic psychiatry, a complex and cost-intensive field with risk assessments and predictions of treatment outcomes as central tasks, there is a need for such predictive tools, for example, to anticipate complex treatment courses and to be able to offer appropriate therapy on an individualized basis. This study aimed to develop a first basic model for the anticipation of adverse treatment courses based on prior compulsory admission and/or conviction as simple and easily objectifiable parameters in offender patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD). With a balanced accuracy of 67% and an AUC of 0.72, gradient boosting proved to be the optimal ML algorithm. Antisocial behavior, physical violence against staff, rule breaking, hyperactivity, delusions of grandeur, fewer feelings of guilt, the need for compulsory isolation, cannabis abuse/dependence, a higher dose of antipsychotics (measured by the olanzapine half-life) and an unfavorable legal prognosis emerged as the ten most influential variables out of a dataset with 209 parameters.

Among the documented causes of the persistent lack of diversity in STEM are bias, discrimination, and harassment of members of underrepresented minority groups (URMs). These issues persist due to continued marginalization, power imbalances, and lack of adequate policies against misconduct in academic and other scientific institutions. All scientists can play important roles in reversing this trend by shifting the culture of academic workplaces to intentionally implement equitable and inclusive policies, set norms for acceptable workplace conduct, and provide opportunities for mentorship and networking. As scientists are increasingly acknowledging the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in science, there is a need for clear direction on how to take antiracist action. Here we present 10 rules to help labs develop antiracists policies and action in an effort to promote racial and ethnic diversity, equity, and inclusion in science.","VBC and AAB are supported by the National Science Foundation (DEB-1844531 and HRD-1725650, respectively).

Non-adjacent correlations can be found in the syntax of some birdsongs, indicating that the choice of what to sing next is determined not only by the current syllable, but also by previous syllables sung. Here we examine the song of the domesticated canary, a complex singer whose song consists of syllables, grouped into phrases that are arranged in flexible sequences. Phrases are defined by a fundamental time-scale that is independent of the underlying syllable duration. We show that the ordering of phrases is governed by long-range rules: the choice of what phrase to sing next in a given context depends on the history of the song, and for some syllables, highly specific rules produce correlations in song over timescales of up to ten seconds. The neural basis of these long-range correlations may provide insight into how complex behaviors are assembled from more elementary, stereotyped modules.","This work is supported by the NSF Science of Learning Center CELEST (SBE-0354378) and by a Career Award at the Scientific Interface to TJG from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund and a Smith family award to TJG.

We found that the chemical shifts of certain (1)H and (13)C nuclei are consistently dependent on the configuration of 1,2-epoxy-ring which could be used as a simple rule for establishing this configuration. Then, from 1D and 2D (COSY, NOESY, HMQC, HMBC) NMR data, applying the observed rule, the structure and stereochemistry of two new, diastereomeric guaianolide-1,2-epoxychlorohydrins, isolated from Achillea serbica, are determined. The NMR data, namely, nuclear overhauser enhancement (NOE) correlations, pointed out two conformations of guaianolide's cycloheptane ring. The semiempirical calculations (AM1 and PM3 methods), performed in order to gain additional information regarding conformations, resulted in three geometries of investigated lactones.

2399,pub.1077629663,,18391278,,Design and implementation of rule-based medical models: an In Silico patho-physiological trauma model for hypovolemic shock.,"Trauma from 'Dirty' Bomb blasts presents complex clinical problems to healthcare providers who must make critical emergency care decisions with incomplete information, usually limited initially only to cursory observations and vital signs. A set of simple, HFSM patho-physiological models of hypovolemic shock based upon blood volume deficits and remedial therapeutic actions has been created for 10 Virtual World scenarios used for training healthcare personnel in the diagnosis and management of 'dirty' bomb victims. Several general rules define the models: * Virtual patients have individual characteristics of gender, age, health status. * An Expanded Organ Injury Scale (EOIS) indicates in descriptive terms the type, severity, and location of the injury. * Traumatic Hemorrhage Classes (THC) determine Blood Volume Deficit. * EOIS/THC Score and Volume Deficit are tightly linked to the Hemorrhage Rate. * Remedial actions include Wound care, Volume Replacement (0.9% saline, packed cells), and a Drug Formulary for Treating Hemorrhagic Shock. The above rules and their logical basis are derived from the literature on emergency medicine (trauma), with modifications for organ injury, and introducing progressive deterioration beyond the body's homeostatic capabilities, into failure of systems and organs, followed by death. The ten unique models and scenarios are designed to run simultaneously in a virtual emergency department to provide training experiences for healthcare personnel with trauma from a 'dirty' bomb blast event.",,,Studies in health technology and informatics,,,"Explosions; Humans; Models, Biological; Shock; United States; User-Computer Interface; Wounds and Injuries",2008,2008,,2008,132,,159-64,Closed,Article,"Heinrichs, Wm LeRoy; Kung, Shyh-Yuan; Dev, Parvati","Heinrichs, Wm LeRoy (SUMMIT (Stanford University Medical Media and Information Technologies) Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305-5466, USA.); Kung, Shyh-Yuan (); Dev, Parvati ()",,"Heinrichs, Wm LeRoy (Stanford University); Kung, Shyh-Yuan (); Dev, Parvati ()",4,0,0.06,0.6,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1077629663,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

However, many simple rules based on CGs (e.g., medical logic modules), have been successfully implemented through a few popular DS models (e.g., prevention reminders, order entry systems). To facilitate mapping of CGs to practical DS models, we propose an empirical method for sub-dividing CGs into modules according to the locus in a clinical process flow model where implementation would be most effective (e.g., post-encounter provider order entry). We further propose a classification of triggers and objectives for CG modules that provides a framework for a DS system to implement the module Successful application of the method to ten diverse CGs in the outpatient setting is described.",,,AMIA Annual Symposium Proceedings,,,"Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Humans; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Programming Languages",2003,2003,,2003,2003,,918,Closed,Article,"Luckmann, Roger S; Boxwala, Aziz A; Greenes, Robert A","Luckmann, Roger S (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.); Boxwala, Aziz A (); Greenes, Robert A ()",,"Luckmann, Roger S (Brigham and Women's Hospital; Harvard University); Boxwala, Aziz A (); Greenes, Robert A ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1076626497,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems,

Early mechanism-based theory asserted that food webs have little omnivory and several properties that are independent of species richness1,2,3,4,6. This theory was overturned by empirical studies that found food webs to be much more complex5,7,8,9,14,15,16,17,18, but these studies did not provide mechanistic explanations for the complexity9. Here we show that a remarkably simple model fills this scientific void by successfully predicting key structural properties of the most complex and comprehensive food webs in the primary literature. These properties include the fractions of species at top, intermediate and basal trophic levels, the means and variabilities of generality, vulnerability and food-chain length, and the degrees of cannibalism, omnivory, looping and trophic similarity. Using only two empirical parameters, species number and connectance, our ‘niche model’ extends the existing ‘cascade model’3,19 and improves its fit ten-fold by constraining species to consume a contiguous sequence of prey in a one-dimensional trophic niche20.","We thank J.

METHODS: Random forest modeling of electronic medical records was used to identify variables that may facilitate earlier FM identification and diagnosis. Subjects aged ≥18 years with two or more listings of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, (ICD-9) code for FM (ICD-9 729.1) ≥30 days apart during the 2012 calendar year were defined as cases among subjects associated with an integrated delivery network and who had one or more health care provider encounter in the Humedica database in calendar years 2011 and 2012. Controls were without the FM ICD-9 codes. Seventy-two demographic, clinical, and health care resource utilization variables were entered into a random forest model with downsampling to account for cohort imbalances (<1% subjects had FM). Importance of the top ten variables was ranked based on normalization to 100% for the variable with the largest loss in predicting performance by its omission from the model. Since random forest is a complex prediction method, a set of simple rules was derived to help understand what factors drive individual predictions.
RESULTS: The ten variables identified by the model were: number of visits where laboratory/non-imaging diagnostic tests were ordered; number of outpatient visits excluding office visits; age; number of office visits; number of opioid prescriptions; number of medications prescribed; number of pain medications excluding opioids; number of medications administered/ordered; number of emergency room visits; and number of musculoskeletal conditions. A receiver operating characteristic curve confirmed the model's predictive accuracy using an independent test set (area under the curve, 0.810). To enhance interpretability, nine rules were developed that could be used with good predictive probability of an FM diagnosis and to identify no-FM subjects.
CONCLUSION: Random forest modeling may help to quantify the predictive probability of an FM diagnosis. Rules can be developed to simplify interpretability. Further validation of these models may facilitate earlier diagnosis and enhance management.","Editorial assistance was provided by E Jay Bienen, who was funded by Pfizer Inc.",,Journal of Pain Research,,,,2015-06-10,2015,2015-06-10,,8,,277-288,All OA; Gold,Article,"Emir, Birol; Masters, Elizabeth T; Mardekian, Jack; Clair, Andrew; Kuhn, Max; Silverman, Stuart L","Emir, Birol (Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA); Masters, Elizabeth T (Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA); Mardekian, Jack (Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA); Clair, Andrew (Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA); Kuhn, Max (Pfizer Inc., Groton, CT, USA); Silverman, Stuart L (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA)","Emir, Birol (Pfizer (United States))","Emir, Birol (Pfizer (United States)); Masters, Elizabeth T (Pfizer (United States)); Mardekian, Jack (Pfizer (United States)); Clair, Andrew (Pfizer (United States)); Kuhn, Max (Pfizer (United States)); Silverman, Stuart L (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center)",18,5,0.73,3.99,http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/jpr.s8256,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1079105768,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

MGE also enhances the state-of-the-art Grammatical Evolution (GE) methods in two directions. First, MGE's representation is modular in that each individual has a set of genes, and each gene is mapped to a neuron by grammatical rules. Second, the proposed representation mitigates two important drawbacks of GE, namely the low scalability and weak locality of representation, toward generating modular and multilayer networks with a high number of neurons. We define and evaluate five different forms of structures with and without modularity using MGE and find single-layer modules with no coupling more productive. Our experiments demonstrate that modularity helps in finding better neural networks faster. We have validated the proposed method using ten well-known classification benchmarks with different sizes, feature counts, and output class counts. Our experimental results indicate that MGE provides superior accuracy with respect to existing NeuroEvolution methods and returns classifiers that are significantly simpler than other machine learning generated classifiers. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that MGE outperforms other GE methods in terms of locality and scalability properties.",,,Evolutionary Computation,,,"Algorithms; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer",2022-05-06,2022,2022-05-06,2022-06-01,30,2,291-327,All OA; Green,Article,"Soltanian, Khabat; Ebnenasir, Ali; Afsharchi, Mohsen","Soltanian, Khabat (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Zanjan, Zanjan 45371-38791, Iran, k.soltanian@znu.ac.ir); Ebnenasir, Ali (Department of Computer Science, Michigan Technological University, Houghton MI 49931, USA, aebnenas@mtu.edu); Afsharchi, Mohsen (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Zanjan, Zanjan 45371-38791, Iran, afsharchi@znu.ac.ir)",,"Soltanian, Khabat (University of Zanjan); Ebnenasir, Ali (Michigan Technological University); Afsharchi, Mohsen (University of Zanjan)",12,8,0.93,7.06,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.02787,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143719376,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

Consensus between unsupervised classification algorithms has been successfully used to categorise patients into these specific groups, but often at the expenses of not classifying the whole set. It is known that fuzzy methodologies can provide linguistic based classification rules. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of fuzzy methodologies to create an easy to interpret set of classification rules, capable of placing the large majority of patients into one of the specified groups.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this paper, we extend a data-driven fuzzy rule-based system for classification purposes (called 'fuzzy quantification subsethood-based algorithm') and combine it with a novel class assignment procedure. The whole approach is then applied to a well characterised breast cancer dataset consisting of ten protein markers for over 1000 patients to refine previously identified groups and to present clinicians with a linguistic ruleset. A range of statistical approaches was used to compare the obtained classes to previously obtained groupings and to assess the proportion of unclassified patients.
RESULTS: A rule set was obtained from the algorithm which features one classification rule per class, using labels of High, Low or Omit for each biomarker, to determine the most appropriate class for each patient. When applied to the whole set of patients, the distribution of the obtained classes had an agreement of 0.9 when assessed using Kendall's Tau with the original reference class distribution. In doing so, only 38 patients out of 1073 remain unclassified, representing a more clinically usable class assignment algorithm.
CONCLUSION: The fuzzy algorithm provides a simple to interpret, linguistic rule set which classifies over 95% of breast cancer patients into one of seven clinical groups.",,,Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,,,"Algorithms; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Female; Fuzzy Logic; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Phenotype; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Reproducibility of Results",2013-06-18,2013,2013-06-18,2013-07,58,3,175-184,All OA; Green,Article,"Soria, Daniele; Garibaldi, Jonathan M.; Green, Andrew R.; Powe, Desmond G.; Nolan, Christopher C.; Lemetre, Christophe; Ball, Graham R.; Ellis, Ian O.","Soria, Daniele (School of Computer Science, Advanced Data Analysis Centre, University of Nottingham, Jubilee Campus, Wollaton Road, Nottingham NG8 1BB, UK); Garibaldi, Jonathan M.

Chemical trends are elucidated and attributed to microscopic properties of the π$$\pi$$-electron-system spanned by atomic pz$$p_z$$-orbitals. We systematically investigate the electronic structure, delocalization of electronic states, effects of disorder, bond torsion, and doping, and correlate these with variable π$$\pi$$-conjugation and nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) aromaticity. Molecular orbitals are obtained from maximally localized Wannier functions that have σ$$\sigma$$- and π$$\pi$$-character, forming distinct σ$$\sigma$$- and π$$\pi$$-bands for all valence states. The Wannier-orbital description goes beyond simple tight-binding models and enables a detailed understanding of the electronic topology, effective electronic coupling and delocalization. It is shown that a meaningful comparison between COFs with different chemical elements can only be made by examining the entire π$$\pi$$-electron system, while a comparison of individual bands (e.g., bands near the Fermi energy) can be a insufficient to derive general design rules for linker and spacer monomer selection. We further identify delocalized states that are spread across tens or hundreds of pores of the 2D COFs and analyze their robustness against structural and energetic disorders like out-of-plane rotations of molecular fragments, different strength of energetic disorder and energetic shifts due to chemical doping.","We would like to thank the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft for financial support [CRC1415, projects No. OR 349/1 and No. OR 349/3 and the Cluster of Excellence e-conversion (Grant No. EXC2089)].

OBJECTIVES: To verify the importance of BMI as a mortality predictor, to identify other important mortality predictors, and to construct a mortality prediction rule in a population eligible for bariatric surgery.
DESIGN: We studied individuals from a population-representative register who met contemporary eligibility criteria for bariatric surgery (BMI, ≥35.0 alone or 30.0-34.9 with an obesity-related comorbidity) from January 1, 1988, through December 31, 1998. We used binary logistic regression to construct a parsimonious model and a clinical prediction rule for 10-year all-cause mortality.
SETTING: The United Kingdom General Practice Research Database, a population-representative primary care registry.
PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen thousand three hundred ninety-four patients aged 18 to 65 years.
EXPOSURE: Bariatric surgery.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Ten-year all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Mean (SD) age was 46.9 (11.9) years, BMI was 36.2 (5.5), and 63.2% of the patients were women. All-cause mortality was 2.1%, and mean follow-up duration was 9.9 years. The final model, which included age (odds ratio, 1.09 per year [95% CI, 1.07-1.10]), type 2 diabetes mellitus (2.25 [1.76-2.87]), current smoking (1.62 [1.28-2.06]), and male sex (1.50 [1.20-1.87]), had a C statistic of 0.768. Although BMI significantly predicted mortality (odds ratio, 1.03 per unit [95% CI, 1.01-1.05]), it did not improve model discrimination or calibration. We divided clinical prediction rule scoring into 4 tiers. All-cause mortality was 0.2% in tier 1, 0.9% in tier 2, 2.0% in tier 3, and 5.2% in tier 4.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: All-cause 10-year mortality in obese individuals eligible for bariatric surgery can be estimated using a simple 4-variable prediction rule based on age, sex, smoking, and diabetes mellitus.

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether it is possible to design deliberation components in decision support interventions using simple models (fast and frugal heuristics).
DESIGN: The 'Take The Best' heuristic (i.e. selection of a 'most important reason') and 'The Tallying' integration algorithm (i.e. unitary weighing of pros and cons) were used to develop two deliberation components embedded in a Web-based decision support intervention for women facing amniocentesis testing. Ten researchers (recruited from 15), nine health-care providers (recruited from 28) and ten pregnant women (recruited from 14) who had recently been offered amniocentesis testing appraised evolving versions of 'your most important reason' (Take The Best) and 'weighing it up' (Tallying).
RESULTS: Most researchers found the tools useful in facilitating decision making although emphasized the need for simple instructions and clear layouts. Health-care providers however expressed concerns regarding the usability and clarity of the tools. By contrast, 7 out of 10 pregnant women found the tools useful in weighing up the pros and cons of each option, helpful in structuring and clarifying their thoughts and visualizing their decision efforts. Several pregnant women felt that 'weighing it up' and 'your most important reason' were not appropriate when facing such a difficult and emotional decision.
CONCLUSION: Theoretical approaches based on fast and frugal heuristics can be used to develop deliberation tools that provide helpful support to patients facing real-world decisions about amniocentesis.",Acknowledgements We thank the midwives at the antenatal clinics for their on‐going support and for approaching participants and distributing information leaflets.,"Funding MA‐D’s PhD, of which this study was a part, was funded by the Sir Halley Stewart Trust, Cambridge, UK.",Health Expectations,,,Adult; Amniocentesis; Decision Support Techniques; Female; Humans; Patient Participation; Pregnancy; Prenatal Diagnosis; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom; User-Computer Interface,2011-01-18,2011,2011-01-18,2012-03,15,1,32-48,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Durand, Marie‐Anne; Wegwarth, Odette; Boivin, Jacky; Elwyn, Glyn","Durand, Marie‐Anne (Senior Project Manager, NHS Direct, London, UK); Wegwarth, Odette (Research Scientist, Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Harding Center for Risk Literacy, Berlin, Germany); Boivin, Jacky (Professor, School of Psychology, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK); Elwyn, Glyn (Professor, NHS Direct, London, UK)",,"Durand, Marie‐Anne (National Health Service England); Wegwarth, Odette (Max Planck Institute for Human Development); Boivin, Jacky (Cardiff University); Elwyn, Glyn (National Health Service England)",16,0,0.62,2.89,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1369-7625.2010.00651.x,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043123503,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,

This manifests not just in the mitigation of barriers to attending traditional physical conferences but also in the presentation of new, and more importantly attainable, opportunities for young scientists to carve out a niche in the landscape of academic meetings. Here, we describe an early ""proof of principle"" of this democratizing power via our experience organizing the Canadian Computational Neuroscience Spotlight (CCNS; crowdcast.io/e/CCNS), a free 2-day virtual meeting that was built entirely amid the pandemic using only virtual tools. While our experience was unique considering the obstacles faced in creating a conference during a pandemic, this was not the only factor differentiating both our experience and the resulting meeting from other contemporary online conferences. Specifically, CCNS was crafted entirely by early career researchers (ECRs) without any sponsors or partners, advertised primarily using social media and ""word of mouth,"" and designed specifically to highlight and engage trainees. From this experience, we have distilled ""10 simple rules"" as a blueprint for the design of new virtual academic meetings, especially in the absence of institutional support or partnerships, in this unprecedented environment. By highlighting the lessons learned in implementing our meeting under these arduous circumstances, we hope to encourage other young scientists to embrace this challenge, which would serve as a critical next step in further democratizing academic meetings.","The minimal costs of organizing CCNS were covered by the organizers, with support from the Krembil Research Institute and the Krembil Foundation. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. We thank the Krembil Research Institute for providing administrative support during the planning of the Canadian Computational Neuroscience Spotlight. We are also immensely grateful to all of the speakers and attendees who made this event a success.","The minimal costs of organizing CCNS were covered by the organizers, with support from the Krembil Research Institute and the Krembil Foundation.

This includes delivering face-to-face programs fully online for at least part of the upcoming academic year for new and continuing cohorts. This temporary pivot will necessitate distance teaching and learning across almost every conceivable pedagogy, from fundamental degrees to professionally accredited ones. Each institution, program, and course will have its own myriad of individualized needs; however, there is a common question that unites us all: how do we provide teaching and assessment to students in a manner that is accessible, fair, equitable, and provides the best learning whilst acknowledging the temporary nature of the pivot? No ""one size fits all"" solution exists, and many of the choices that need to be made will be far from simple; however, this paper provides a starting point and basic principles to facilitate discussions taking place around the globe by balancing what we know from the pedagogy of online learning with the practicalities imposed by this crisis and any future crises.",This work was not funded.,This work was not funded.,PLOS Computational Biology,,Russell Schwartz,"Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Coronavirus Infections; Education, Distance; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2",2020-10-01,2020,2020-10-01,,16,10,e1008242,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nordmann, Emily; Horlin, Chiara; Hutchison, Jacqui; Murray, Jo-Anne; Robson, Louise; Seery, Michael K.; MacKay, Jill R.

Traditionally, the photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) properties of the film are obtained by measuring the actual decomposition of organic pollutants under ultraviolet or visible light, which may take tens of minutes or even hours. Here, through the combined analysis of the apparent features and PEC properties, we found that the structure would affect the color and optical performance, and the films with different colors showed different PEC performance. Interestingly, after repeated verifications, we got a rule that the PEC performance of the TiO2 films decreased in the order with typical color of yellow, blue-green, dark yellow, blue, yellow-grey, and purple. Therefore, we provide a new idea for the visualization screening of PEC performance for the film photoelectrodes, that is, color can be used as a quick selection indicator for TiO2 films.","This work was supported by the Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province (2017JZ0021, 2017SZ0039).

We identified shape-based virtual screening with ROCS as a highly effective computational approach to enrich known MGBs in top-ranked molecules. Discovery of ten previously unknown MGBs by shape-based screening further confirmed the relevance of ligand shape for minor groove affinity. Based on experimental testing we propose three simple rules (at least two positive charges, four nitrogen atoms, and one aromatic ring) as filters to reach even better enrichment of true positives in ROCS hit lists. Interestingly, shape-based ranking of MGBs versus FDA-approved drugs again leads to high enrichment rates, indicating complementary coverage of chemical shape space and indicating minor groove affinity to be unfavorable for approval of drugs targeting proteins.",This work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund (project P19756).

A technical note on the use of the PEAK PlasmaBladeTM,"BackgroundImplantable pulse generator (IPG) replacement is considered a simple procedure, but in case of extension cable damage or IPG pocket infection, it can dramatically affect a patient’s quality of life. Higher risk of infection has been reported after IPG replacement procedures rather than after primary deep brain stimulation lead implantation, and some authors suggested that the IPG pocket capsule could play a pivotal role in causing it. In this technical note we present a capsulectomy technique adopted in IPG replacement procedures.MethodsBetween July and October 2015, we carried out ten outpatient IPG replacement procedures at the chest and abdomen under local anesthesia for battery depletion using the PEAK PlasmaBladeTM. All patients were followed for at least 2 months to rule out any hardware malfunction and infection.ResultsAll ten procedures were uneventful. No extension cable damage occurred. No IPG pocket infection occurred, also not in the follow-up. Mean surgical time was 30 min.ConclusionsComplete capsulectomy is not feasible with basic surgical instruments, and the PEAK PlasmaBladeTM pencil appears to be a helpful tool in carrying out the procedure.",,No funding was received for this research.,Acta Neurochirurgica,,,"Deep Brain Stimulation; Electrodes, Implanted; Humans; Postoperative Complications; Replantation",2016-04-15,2016,2016-04-15,2016-06,158,6,1165-1168,Closed,Article,"Servello, Domenico; Bona, Alberto R.; Zekaj, Edvin","Servello, Domenico (Neurosurgery Department, Galeazzi Research and Clinical Hospital, University of Milan, Milano, Italy); Bona, Alberto R.

With such an explosion of data, it is increasingly difficult to sift through the literature and distinguish spurious from replicable findings. Furthermore, due to the large number of studies, it is challenging to keep track of the wealth of findings. A variety of meta-analytical methods (coordinate-based and image-based) have been developed to help summarise and integrate the vast amount of data arising from neuroimaging studies. However, the field lacks specific guidelines for the conduct of such meta-analyses. Based on our combined experience, we propose best-practice recommendations that researchers from multiple disciplines may find helpful. In addition, we provide specific guidelines and a checklist that will hopefully improve the transparency, traceability, replicability and reporting of meta-analytical results of neuroimaging data.","Acknowledgements This study was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, EI 816/4-1, LA 3071/3-1), the National Institute of Mental Health (R01-MH074457), the Helmholtz Portfolio Theme “Supercomputing and Modelling for the Human Brain” and the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Grant Agreement No. 7202070 (HBP SGA1).

This transient period, between finishing a PhD and finding a permanent position, is when early-career researchers develop independent research programs and establish collaborative relationships that can make a successful career. Traditionally, postdocs physically relocate-sometimes multiple times-for these short-term appointments, which creates challenges that can disproportionately affect members of traditionally underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). However, many research activities involving analytical and quantitative work do not require a physical presence in a lab and can be accomplished remotely. Other fields have embraced remote work, yet many academics have been hesitant to hire remote postdocs. In this article, we present advice to both principal investigators (PIs) and postdocs for successfully navigating a remote position. Using the combined experience of the authors (as either remote postdocs or employers of remote postdocs), we provide a road map to overcome the real (and perceived) obstacles associated with remote work. With planning, communication, and creativity, remote postdocs can be a fully functioning and productive member of a research lab. Further, our rules can be useful for research labs generally and can help foster a more flexible and inclusive environment.","This work was partially supported by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation’s DataDriven Discovery Initiative through grant GBMF4563 to EPW (https://www.moore.org/programs/science).

Twenty-five conformers have been analyzed, ten of which have not been reported before. We extend the silica (SiO(2))(6) topology phase space using QTAIM; the Poincaré-Hopf topological sum rules are applied and used to identify the spanning set of topologies, and this includes finding eight new distinct topologies that satisfy the Poincaré-Hopf relation. A simple phase diagram of the solutions of the Poincaré-Hopf relation is created with the aid of a new classification scheme to determine the boundary between topological stability and instability. Sum rules are then found to be applicable to any set of isomers. We determine that O-O bonding interactions exist for the silica (SiO(2))(6) conformers in regions where the energy surface is flattest. In addition, we identify unstable local minima in the topology of the charge density in order to further compare conformer instabilities. We quantify the dimensionality of a molecule using the Poincaré-Hopf relation instead of Euclidean geometry. This quantum topological definition of geometry shows that the four most energetically stable (SiO(2))(6) conformers are quantified as two-dimensional within the new quantum topology.","The Knowledge Foundation (Grant 2004/0284) and the Hundred Talents Foundation of Hunan Province are gratefully acknowledged for the support of S.J. and S.R.K.

METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study in children 0 to 14 years, undergoing peripheral intravenous placement by doctors in the emergency department of a medium-sized general hospital. Before intravenous placement attempts, demographic data inclusive of age and DIVA score were recorded. A maximum of 3 attempts per doctor were allowed, after which a more senior doctor undertook subsequent attempts. The site of successful placement was recorded.
RESULTS: Five hundred children were enrolled. The male-female ratio was 1.3:1. One hundred thirty-three (26.6%) were less than 1 year, 103 (20.6%) were aged 1 to 2 years, and 264 (52.8%) were 3 years or older. One hundred ten children (22%) had a failed intravenous placement on the first attempt. Of the 151 children with a DIVA score of 4 or more, 57 (37.7%) had a failed intravenous placement, validating the clinical prediction rule. Only 5 subjects (1%) did not have intravenous placement after 6 attempts.

OBJECTIVE: To derive a clinical decision rule that is highly sensitive for detecting acute C-spine injury and will allow emergency department (ED) physicians to be more selective in use of radiography in alert and stable trauma patients.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study conducted from October 1996 to April 1999, in which physicians evaluated patients for 20 standardized clinical findings prior to radiography. In some cases, a second physician performed independent interobserver assessments.
SETTING: Ten EDs in large Canadian community and university hospitals.
PATIENTS: Convenience sample of 8924 adults (mean age, 37 years) who presented to the ED with blunt trauma to the head/neck, stable vital signs, and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinically important C-spine injury, evaluated by plain radiography, computed tomography, and a structured follow-up telephone interview. The clinical decision rule was derived using the kappa coefficient, logistic regression analysis, and chi(2) recursive partitioning techniques.
RESULTS: Among the study sample, 151 (1.7%) had important C-spine injury. The resultant model and final Canadian C-Spine Rule comprises 3 main questions: (1) is there any high-risk factor present that mandates radiography (ie, age >/=65 years, dangerous mechanism, or paresthesias in extremities)? (2) is there any low-risk factor present that allows safe assessment of range of motion (ie, simple rear-end motor vehicle collision, sitting position in ED, ambulatory at any time since injury, delayed onset of neck pain, or absence of midline C-spine tenderness)? and (3) is the patient able to actively rotate neck 45 degrees to the left and right? By cross-validation, this rule had 100% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 98%-100%) and 42.5% specificity (95% CI, 40%-44%) for identifying 151 clinically important C-spine injuries. The potential radiography ordering rate would be 58.2%.
CONCLUSION: We have derived the Canadian C-Spine Rule, a highly sensitive decision rule for use of C-spine radiography in alert and stable trauma patients. If prospectively validated in other cohorts, this rule has the potential to significantly reduce practice variation and inefficiency in ED use of C-spine radiography.",,,JAMA,,,"Adult; Aged; Canada; Cervical Vertebrae; Craniocerebral Trauma; Decision Support Techniques; Emergency Medical Services; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neck Injuries; Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care; Prospective Studies; Radiography; Regression Analysis; Risk Assessment; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Traumatology; Wounds, Nonpenetrating",2001-10-17,2001,,2001-10-17,286,15,1841-1848,Closed,Article,"Stiell, I G; Wells, G A; Vandemheen, K L; Clement, C M; Lesiuk, H; De Maio, V J; Laupacis, A; Schull, M; McKnight, R D; Verbeek, R; Brison, R; Cass, D; Dreyer, J; Eisenhauer, M A; Greenberg, G H; MacPhail, I; Morrison, L; Reardon, M; Worthington, J","Stiell, I G (Clinical Epidemiology Unit, F6, Ottawa Health Research Institute, 1053 Carling Ave, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1Y 4E9. istiell@ohri.ca); Wells, G A (); Vandemheen, K L (); Clement, C M (); Lesiuk, H (); De Maio, V J (); Laupacis, A (); Schull, M (); McKnight, R D (); Verbeek, R (); Brison, R (); Cass, D (); Dreyer, J (); Eisenhauer, M A (); Greenberg, G H (); MacPhail, I (); Morrison, L (); Reardon, M (); Worthington, J ()",,"Stiell, I G (Ottawa Hospital); Wells, G A (); Vandemheen, K L (); Clement, C M (); Lesiuk, H (); De Maio, V J (); Laupacis, A (); Schull, M (); McKnight, R D (); Verbeek, R (); Brison, R (); Cass, D (); Dreyer, J (); Eisenhauer, M A (); Greenberg, G H (); MacPhail, I (); Morrison, L (); Reardon, M (); Worthington, J ()",1086,82,25.84,169.51,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1048819153,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences,

Recurrence quantification to assess Markov order for short, symbolic, musical compositions","It is rarely possible to precisely characterise the system underlying a series of observations. Hypothesis testing, which involves assessing simple assumptions about driving mechanisms, provides hope that we can at least rule out certain possibilities regarding the nature of the system. Unfortunately, the brevity, nonstationarity, and symbolic nature of certain time series of interest undermines traditional hypothesis tests. Fortunately, recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) has an established record of success in understanding short and nonstationary time series. We evaluate the suitability of measures of RQA as test statistics in surrogate data tests of the hypothesis that ten compositions by the Baroque composer J. S. Bach (1685-1750) arose from a Markov chain. More specifically, we estimate the size (the rate at which true hypotheses are incorrectly rejected) and power (the rate at which false hypotheses are correctly rejected) from empirical rejection rates across 1000 realisations, for each of the ten compositions, of the surrogate algorithm. We compare hypothesis tests based on RQA measures to tests based on the conditional entropy, an established test statistic for surrogate data tests of Markov order, and find that the RQA measure Lmax provides more consistent rejection of the fairly implausible hypothesis that Bach's brain was a Markov chain.","M.S. is supported by the Australian Research Council through Discovery Project No. DP140100203.

2219,pub.1057852030,10.1063/1.2357935,17059235,,Unbiased sampling of lattice Hamilton path ensembles,"Hamilton paths, or Hamiltonian paths, are walks on a lattice which visit each site exactly once. They have been proposed as models of globular proteins and of compact polymers. A previously published algorithm [Mansfield, Macromolecules 27, 5924 (1994)] for sampling Hamilton paths on simple square and simple cubic lattices is tested for bias and for efficiency. Because the algorithm is a Metropolis Monte Carlo technique obviously satisfying detailed balance, we need only demonstrate ergodicity to ensure unbiased sampling. Two different tests for ergodicity (exact enumeration on small lattices, nonexhaustive enumeration on larger lattices) demonstrate ergodicity unequivocally for small lattices and provide strong support for ergodicity on larger lattices. Two other sampling algorithms [Ramakrishnan et al., J. Chem. Phys. 103, 7592 (1995); Lua et al., Polymer 45, 717 (2004)] are both known to produce biases on both 2x2x2 and 3x3x3 lattices, but it is shown here that the current algorithm gives unbiased sampling on these same lattices. Successive Hamilton paths are strongly correlated, so that many iterations are required between statistically independent samples. Rules for estimating the number of iterations needed to dissipate these correlations are given. However, the iteration time is so fast that the efficiency is still very good except on extremely large lattices. For example, even on lattices of total size 10x10x10 we are able to generate tens of thousands of uncorrelated Hamilton paths per hour of CPU time.",These computations were performed using the High Performance Computing Facility at Stevens Institute of Technology.,,The Journal of Chemical Physics,,,,2006-10-18,2006,2006-10-18,2006-10-21,125,15,154103,Closed,Article,"Mansfield, Marc L","Mansfield, Marc L (Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, New Jersey 07030, USA. marc.mansfield@stevens.edu)",,"Mansfield, Marc L (Stevens Institute of Technology)",16,3,0.24,3.49,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1057852030,51 Physical Sciences; 5103 Classical Physics,

The pathologies involved include simple infections, such as folliculitis, acne, and delay in the process of wound healing, as well as serious infections in the CNS, meninges, lung, heart, and other areas.
AIM: This research aims to propose a series of molecules derived from 2-naphthoic acid as a bioactive in the fight against S. aureus bacteria through in silico studies using molecular modeling tools.
METHODS: A virtual screening of analogues was done in consideration of the results that showed activity according to the prediction model performed in the KNIME Analytics Platform 3.6, violations of the Lipinski rule, absorption rate, cytotoxicity risks, energy of binder-receptor interaction through molecular docking, and the stability of the best profile ligands in the active site of the proteins used (PDB ID 4DXD and 4WVG).
RESULTS: Seven of the 48 analogues analyzed showed promising results for bactericidal action against S. aureus.
CONCLUSION: It is possible to conclude that ten of the 48 compounds derived from 2-naphthoic acid presented activity based on the prediction model generated, of which seven presented no toxicity and up to one violation to the Lipinski rule.",The authors wish to acknowledge the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) and Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES).,,Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry,,,"Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Machine Learning; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Models, Molecular; Molecular Structure; Naphthalenes; Staphylococcus aureus",2020,2020,,2020,20,4,293-304,Closed,Article,"Monteiro, Alex France Messias; Scotti, Marcus Tullius; Speck-Planche, Alejandro; Barros, Renata Priscila Costa; Scotti, Luciana","Monteiro, Alex France Messias (Federal University of Paraíba, Health Science Center, 50670-910, João Pessoa, PB, Brazil, ;); Scotti, Marcus Tullius (Federal University of Paraíba, Health Science Center, 50670-910, João Pessoa, PB, Brazil, ;); Speck-Planche, Alejandro (Department of Chemistry, Institute of Pharmacy, I.M.

This model predicts that M(L) ∝ M(S)(3/4) ∝ M(R)(3/4) such that M(S) ∝ M(R) and that G(L) ∝ G(S) ∝ G(R). A large synoptic data set for standing plant organ biomass and organ biomass production spanning ten orders of magnitude in total plant body mass supports these predictions. Although the numerical values for the allometric ""constants"" governing these scaling relationships differ between angiosperms and conifers, across all species, standing leaf, stem, and root biomass, respectively, comprise 8%, 67%, and 25% of total plant biomass, whereas annual leaf, stem, and root biomass growth represent 30%, 57%, and 13% of total plant growth. Importantly, our analyses of large data sets confirm the existence of scaling exponents predicted by theory. These scaling ""rules"" emerge from simple biophysical mechanisms that hold across a remarkably broad spectrum of ecologically and phyletically divergent herbaceous and tree-sized monocot, dicot, and conifer species.

Wearable technologies, due to their low costs and high portability, are increasingly being used in gait and other medical analyses. This paper evaluates the use of low-cost homemade textile pressure sensors to recognize gait phases. Ten sensors were integrated into stretch pants, achieving an inexpensive and pervasive solution. Nevertheless, such a simple fabrication process leads to significant sensitivity variability among sensors, hindering their adoption in precision-demanding medical applications. To tackle this issue, we evaluated the textile sensors for the classification of gait phases over three machine learning algorithms for time-series signals, namely, random forest (RF), time series forest (TSF), and multi-representation sequence learner (Mr-SEQL). Training and testing signals were generated from participants wearing the sensing pants in a test run under laboratory conditions and from an inertial sensor attached to the same pants for comparison purposes. Moreover, a new annotation method to facilitate the creation of such datasets using an ordinary webcam and a pose detection model is presented, which uses predefined rules for label generation. The results show that textile sensors successfully detect the gait phases with an average precision of 91.2% and 90.5% for RF and TSF, respectively, only 0.8% and 2.3% lower than the same values obtained from the IMU. This situation changes for Mr-SEQL, which achieved a precision of 79% for the textile sensors and 36.8% for the IMU.

For the W(4), W(5) and W(6) clusters, nine, fourteen and twenty-seven conformers, respectively, have been analyzed. For the W(4), W(5) and W(6) clusters one, two and three of these structures, respectively, have not been reported before. We then proceed to extend the W(4), W(5) and W(6) water cluster topology space using QTAIM; the Poincaré-Hopf topological sum rules are applied to create rules to identify the spanning set of conformer topologies, this includes finding three, ten and eight new distinct topologies that satisfy the Poincaré-Hopf relation for W(4), W(5) and W(6) respectively. The topological stability of degenerate solutions to the Poincaré-Hopf relation is compared by evaluating the proximity to rupturing of critical points of the gradient vector field of the charge density. We introduce a QTAIM topology space to replace the inconsistent use of Euclidean geometry to determine whether a cluster is 1-, 2- or 3-D. We show from the topology of the charge density that the conformers of the W(4), W(5) clusters are more energetically stable in less compact, planar forms, conversely the conformers of W(6) are more energetically stable with compact 3-D topologies. Quantifying the degree of covalent character in the hydrogen bonding for the W(4), W(5) and W(6) clusters independently verifies this finding. Differences in simple rules for the number of hydrogen bonds obeying the Bernal-Fowler ice rules between W(4), W(5) and W(6) reflect the transition from 2-D to 3-D structures being more energetically stable. In addition, we identify a new class of O-O bonding interactions that are up to 48% longer than the inter-nuclear separation and appear to be failed hydrogen bonds.","The Knowledge Foundation (grant number 2004/0284) and the Hundred Talents Foundation of Hunan Province are gratefully acknowledged for the support of S.J. and S.R.K.

Three birds (C5, C8, and C9) successfully solved the oblique parallel strings task (T3). The azure-winged magpies exhibited proximity selection in the oblique parallel strings task (C1 and C4 in T2), and the task with one string folded at a right angle (C3, C6 and C8 in T5). Several subjects also performed simple strategies in other unresolved tasks, e.g., random selection, trial-and-error learning, and side bias strategies (i.e., a certain degree of “left-handed” tendency). These results demonstrated that the azure-winged magpie possesses the potential to solve simple multiple-string tasks, although when faced with more difficult problems they could not solve them.","This work was financially supported by the Research Fund for General Survey of Terrestrial Wildlife Resources (2015HXFWBHQ-SJL-01), Beijing, China.",,Animal Cognition,,,Animals; Cognition; Learning; Motivation; Passeriformes; Problem Solving,2020-07-07,2020,2020-07-07,2021-01,24,1,1-10,Closed,Article,"Wang, Lin; Zhang, Dujing; Sui, Jinling","Wang, Lin (School of Ecology and Nature Conservation, Beijing Forestry University, Qinghuadonglu No. 35, Haidian District, 100083, Beijing, China); Zhang, Dujing (School of Ecology and Nature Conservation, Beijing Forestry University, Qinghuadonglu No. 35, Haidian District, 100083, Beijing, China); Sui, Jinling (School of Ecology and Nature Conservation, Beijing Forestry University, Qinghuadonglu No. 35, Haidian District, 100083, Beijing, China)","Sui, Jinling (Beijing Forestry University)","Wang, Lin (Beijing Forestry University); Zhang, Dujing (Beijing Forestry University); Sui, Jinling (Beijing Forestry University)",3,2,0.17,0.92,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129065518,52 Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,

Ackers. 1985. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA.82:5347-5351). The approach taken here is an application of the general principle of hierarchical levels of allosteric control, or nesting, as suggested by Wyman (Wyman, J. 1972. Curr. Top. Cell. Reg. 6:207-223). The model is an extension of the simple two-state MWC model (Monod, J., J. Wyman, and J.P. Changeux. 1965. J. Mol. Biol. 12:88-118) using the idea of cooperative binding within the T (deoxy) form of the macromolecule, and has recently been described as a ""cooperon"" model (Di Cera, E. 1985. Ph.D. thesis). The T-state cooperative binding is described using simple interaction rules first devised by Pauling (Pauling, L. 1935. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 21:186-191).

                  INTERNIST-1 is an experimental computer program for consultation in general internal medicine. On a series of test cases, its performance has been shown to be similar to that of staff physicians at a university hospital. Despite INTERNIST-1’s apparent success in dealing with complex cases involving multiple diagnoses in the same patient, many shortcomings in both its knowledge representation schemes and its diagnostic algorithms still remain. Among the known problems are lack of anatomical and temporal reasoning, inadequate representation of degrees of severity of findings and illnesses, and failure to reason properly about causality. These drawbacks must be corrected before INTERNIST-1’s successor program, CADUCEUS, can be used. It is estimated that CADUCEUS will not be ready for release to the general medical community for five to ten years.
                  Broader problems faced by all medical diagnostic consultant systems are: design of an efficient human interface; development and completion of medical knowledge bases; expansion of diagnostic algorithms from simple heuristic rules to include a range of complex reasoning strategies, and development of a method for validating computer programs for clinical use.",,,Methods of Information in Medicine,,,"Computers; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Humans; Referral and Consultation; Software",1984-01,1984,2018-02-17,1984-01,23,01,9-14,Closed,Article,"Miller, R.

The coating of the conducting polymer is only present on the surface of the substrate (penetration depth ∼ 200 μm) to retain the functionality and wearability of the textile. The wires fabricated by different patterning techniques provide a wide range of resistance, i.e., tens of kΩ/□ to less than 2 Ω/□ that allows the resistance to be tailored to a specific application. The sheet resistance is measured to be as low as 1.6 Ω/□, and the breakdown current is as high as 0.37 A for a 1 mm wide line. The specific breakdown current exceeds the previously reported values of macroscopic carbon nanotube based materials. Simple circuits composed of the printed wires are demonstrated, and resistance of the circuit from the measurement agrees with the calculated value based on Kirchhoff's rules. Additionally, the printed PEDOT:PSS wires show less than 6.2% change in sheet resistance after three washing and drying cycles using detergent.",We thank Technology Commercialization Partner of the University of Connecticut for the Prototype Grant.,,ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces,,,,2016-10-03,2016,2016-10-03,2016-10-12,8,40,26998-27005,Closed,Article,"Guo, Yang; Otley, Michael T.; Li, Mengfang; Zhang, Xiaozheng; Sinha, Sneh K.; Treich, Gregory M.; Sotzing, Gregory A.","Guo, Yang (Polymer Program, Institute of Materials Science, University of Connecticut, 97 North Eagleville Road, Storrs, Connecticut, 06269, United States); Otley, Michael T.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the International Ovarian Tumour Analysis (IOTA) logistic regression model (LR2), ultrasound Simple Rules (SR), the Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) and subjective assessment (SA) for preoperative characterisation of adnexal masses, when ultrasonography is performed by examiners with different background training and experience.Methods:A 2-year prospective multicentre cross-sectional study. Thirty-five level II ultrasound examiners contributed in three UK hospitals. Transvaginal ultrasonography was performed using a standardised approach. The final outcome was the surgical findings and histological diagnosis. To characterise the adnexal masses, the six-variable prediction model (LR2) with a cutoff of 0.1, the RMI with cutoff of 200, ten SR (five rules for malignancy and five rules for benignity) and SA were applied. The area under the curves (AUCs) for performance of LR2 and RMI were calculated. Diagnostic performance measures for all models assessed were sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR−), and the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR).Results:Nine-hundred and sixty-two women with adnexal masses underwent transvaginal ultrasonography, whereas 255 had surgery. Prevalence of malignancy was 29% (49 primary invasive epithelial ovarian cancers, 18 borderline ovarian tumours, and 7 metastatic tumours). The AUCs for LR2 and RMI for all masses were 0.94 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89–0.97) and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.83–0.94), respectively. In premenopausal women, LR2−RMI difference was 0.09 (95% CI: 0.03–0.15) compared with −0.02 (95% CI: −0.08 to 0.04) in postmenopausal women. For all masses, the DORs for LR2, RMI, SR+SA (using SA when SR inapplicable), SR+MA (assuming malignancy when SR inapplicable), and SA were 62 (95% CI: 27–142), 43 (95% CI: 19–97), 109 (95% CI: 44–274), 66 (95% CI: 27–158), and 70 (95% CI: 30–163), respectively.Conclusion:Overall, the test performance of IOTA prediction models and rules as well as the RMI was maintained in examiners with varying levels of training and experience.","AS is a clinical research fellow at the Imperial College London.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Simple rule-of-thumb (RoT) algorithms (i.e. 3 lbs in 1 day and 5 lbs in 3 days) and a moving average convergence divergence (MACD) algorithm were compared. WHF was defined as hospitalization for WHF or worsening of breathlessness or leg oedema. Of 168 patients, 45 were hospitalized with WHF and 76 were hospitalized for other reasons. On average, weight gain occurred in the 14 days prior to WHF hospitalizations but not in the 14 days prior to non-WHF hospitalizations [1.9 +/- 4.7 lbs (0.9 +/- 2.1 kg) vs. -0.4 +/- 2.5 lbs (-0.2 +/- 1.1 kg), P < 0.0001]. The true alerts rate was higher for the RoT algorithms compared with the MACD (58 and 65% vs. 20%). However, the RoT algorithms had much higher false alert rates (54 and 58% vs. 9%) rendering them of little practical use for predicting WHF events.
CONCLUSION: A MACD algorithm is more specific but less sensitive than RoT when trying to predict episodes of WHF based on daily weight measurements. However, many episodes of WHF do not appear to be associated with weight gain and therefore telemonitoring of weight alone may not have great value for heart failure management.",,The analysis included in this paper was funded by GE Healthcare (USA).,European Journal of Heart Failure,,,"Aged; Algorithms; Disease Progression; Europe; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Failure; Home Care Services, Hospital-Based; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Sensitivity and Specificity; Telemetry; Weight Gain",2009-03-29,2009,2009-03-29,2009-04,11,4,420-427,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Zhang, Jufen; Goode, Kevin M.; Cuddihy, Paul E.; Cleland, John G.F.; Investigators, on behalf of the TEN‐HMS","Zhang, Jufen (Division of Cardiovascular and Respiratory Studies, Department of Cardiology, Postgraduate Medical Institute/Hull York Medical School, Medical Research Building, Castle Hill Hospital, Castle Road, Kingston‐upon‐Hull, East Yorkshire, HU16 5JQ, UK); Goode, Kevin M.

In this study, immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangements by Southern blot using DNA extracted from FFPE tissue samples were studied.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Eleven paired freshly frozen and FFPE tissue samples were evaluated for immunoglobulin gene rearrangements by PCR and Southern blot analyses. An additional 14 selected samples sent to our laboratory to rule out lymphoma, for which only FFPE tissue (no frozen tissue) was available and for which PCR was interpreted as negative, were evaluated by the same techniques. Southern blots generated from DNA extracted from FFPE tissues were qualitatively identical to those generated from DNA extracted from fresh or freshly frozen tissue and correlated well with the final diagnoses. Ten interpretable Southern blots were generated in the 14 cases in which no frozen tissue was available. Four of these ten blots were interpreted as positive for an immunoglobulin gene rearrangement. Although the number of samples analyzed is small, success with Southern blotting correlated with increased sample size and sample width (1.17 vs 0.49 cm(2); P <.024; 0.71 vs 0.43 cm; P <. 049, respectively).

They distill complex ecological relationships into simplified rules and identify the species necessary for sample classification on the basis of detailed ecological inventories. The usefulness of this technique to characterize and represent differences in the grape mycobiota of distinct origins was evaluated. Grapes from four Portuguese winemaking regions were selected for a 3-year study: Alentejo, Douro, Ribatejo and Vinhos Verdes. The mycobiota of grapes was assessed with plating methods and the frequencies of isolations of the fungal taxa identified in 32 samples were used as a training dataset. The CT algorithm selected the fungal taxa and respective frequencies to classify grapes according to its region of origin. The ten-fold cross-validation technique was used for model evaluation. The success rate of the model was quantified and expressed in the number of correctly classified samples overall and into region. Furthermore, model refinement was performed using attribute selection algorithms and class redefinition. A simple tree model was generated that classified grapes into three regional origins: Douro, South (Alentejo and Ribatejo classes together) and Vinhos Verdes, on the basis of the incidence of Aspergillus niger aggregate and Penicillium thomii in samples with an accuracy of 82%.

Providers may benefit from guidance (via decision rules) for personalizing aspects of treatment, such as level-of-care (LOC) placements, like choosing between outpatient or inpatient care. The field lacks an empirically-supported foundation to inform the development of an adaptive LOC-placement protocol. This work begins to build the evidence base for adaptive protocols by estimating them from a large observational dataset.
METHODS: We estimated two-stage LOC-placement protocols adapted to individual adolescent characteristics collected from the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs assessment tool (n = 10,131 adolescents). We used a modified version of Q-learning, a regression-based method for estimating personalized treatment rules over time, to estimate four protocols, each targeting a potentially distinct treatment goal: one primary outcome (a composite of ten positive treatment outcomes) and three secondary (substance frequency, substance problems, and emotional problems). We compared the adaptive protocols to non-adaptive protocols using an independent dataset.
RESULTS: Intensive outpatient was recommended for all adolescents at intake for the primary outcome, while low-risk adolescents were recommended for no further treatment at followup while higher-risk patients were recommended to inpatient. Our adaptive protocols outperformed static protocols by an average of 0.4 standard deviations (95 % confidence interval 0.2-0.6) of the primary outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Adaptive protocols provide a simple one-to-one guide between adolescents' needs and recommended treatment which can be used as decision support for clinicians making LOC-placement decisions.","We thank the project’s advisory board members, particularly Michael Dennis, David Gastfriend, and Daniel McCaffrey, for their invaluable input to the study.

Here, we propose 10 ""rules"" centered on 2 best practice components: clean code and testing. These 2 areas are relatively straightforward and provide substantial utility relative to the learning investment. Adopting clean code practices helps to standardize and organize software code in order to enhance readability and reduce cognitive load for both the initial developer and subsequent contributors; this allows developers to concentrate on core functionality and reduce errors. Clean coding styles make software code more amenable to testing, including unit tests that work best with modular and consistent software code. Unit tests interrogate specific and isolated coding behavior to reduce coding errors and ensure intended functionality, especially as code increases in complexity; unit tests also implicitly provide example usages of code. Other forms of testing are geared to discover erroneous behavior arising from unexpected inputs or emerging from the interaction of complex codebases. Although conforming to coding styles and designing tests can add time to the software development project in the short term, these foundational tools can help to improve the correctness, quality, usability, and maintainability of open-source scientific software code. They also advance the principal point of scientific research: producing accurate results in a reproducible way. In addition to suggesting several tips for getting started with clean code and testing practices, we recommend numerous tools for the popular open-source scientific software languages Python, R, and Julia.","This research was funded in part by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (https://www.moore.org/) through Grant GBMF3834, by the Alfred P.

Despite the complexity of social insect colonies, individual social insects are generally thought to have simple, undifferentiated relationships. Here we show that Polistes fuscatus paper wasps, which individually recognize conspecifics, remember the identity of social partners for at least a week, even if they interact with ten other wasps. Therefore, social interactions among paper wasps are based on robust memories of past interactions with particular individuals rather than simple rules. Considering the small size of wasp brains, these results suggest that at least some aspects of social cognition may not be as cognitively demanding as is generally assumed.","We would like to thank Thore Bergman, Robert Seyfarth and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper.

There are many methods for pain relief and to treat discomfort during the procedure but we compared the efficacy of intravenous (IV) midazolam for pain control.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective study of 50 patients. All patients underwent a ten quadrant biopsy. The patients were divided into two groups: group 1 (study group) which included 25 patients who used 1 ml of IV midazolam and group 2 (control group) which included 25 patients who did not use IV midazolam.
RESULTS: In group 1, of 25 patients only 1 patient had mild pain (VAS 2) during and after the procedure. In group 2, of 25 patients, 15 patients had pain during the procedure.
CONCLUSION: Midazolam is a benzodiazepine derivative with an anxiolytic, sedative, amnestic and hypnotic action. Our study shows that using midazolam is a very simple technique which gives excellent analgesia and no other analgesia was required. No monitoring was needed, there was a very low incidence of complications and it did not require any technical expertise.",,,Urologia Internationalis,,,"Analgesia; Anesthetics, Intravenous; Biopsy; Humans; Male; Midazolam; Pain; Prospective Studies; Prostate; Ultrasonography",2009-10-13,2009,2009-10-13,2009,83,3,333-336,Closed,Article,"Shrimali, Pritesh; Bhandari, Yogesh; Kharbanda, Sushil; Patil, Mangesh; Srinivas, Vardachary; Gaitonde, Satish; Mankeshwar, Ranjit","Shrimali, Pritesh (P.D.

These tight temporal correlations, on the order of tens of milliseconds, are incompatible with significantly longer behavioral time scales, and as such might not be able to account for plasticity induced by behavior. Indeed, recent findings in hippocampus suggest that rapid, bidirectional synaptic plasticity which modifies place fields in CA1 operates at behavioral time scales. These experimental results suggest that presynaptic activity generates synaptic eligibility traces both for potentiation and depression, which last on the order of seconds. These traces can be converted to changes in synaptic efficacies by the activation of an instructive signal that depends on naturally occurring or experimentally induced plateau potentials. We have developed a simple mathematical model that is consistent with these observations. This model can be fully analyzed to find the fixed points of induced place fields and how these fixed points depend on system parameters such as the size and shape of presynaptic place fields, the animal's velocity during induction, and the parameters of the plasticity rule. We also make predictions about the convergence time to these fixed points, both for induced and pre-existing place fields.","We would like to thank Jeff Magee, Sandro Romani, and Aaron Milstein for the productive discussions and comments regarding this work.","Funding.

However, the impact of these initiatives often goes unmeasured and underappreciated.

Here we propose the following guidelines for cultivating a successful women-in-STEM-focused group based upon survey results from our own scientific community as well as the experience of our WiSE group leaders. We hope these recommendations can provide guidance to advocacy groups at other research and academic organizations that wish to strengthen their efforts.

Since their invention more than ten years ago, research attention has been mainly focused on the study of multicomponent alloys with equiatomic or near-equiatomic compositions. Here we propose a novel design of non-equiatomic medium-entropy alloys that contain one matrix element and several equiatomic alloying elements. To verify the utility of this new design, a series of Co-free Fex(CrNiAl)100−x (at.%, 25 ≤ x ≤ 65) medium-entropy alloys were designed from the much-studied FeNiCrCoAl high-entropy alloy. Detailed characterization reveals that the alloys exhibit novel two-phase microstructures consisting of B2-ordered nanoprecipitates and BCC-disordered matrix. As the alloys deviate far from equiatomic composition, the structure of the nanoprecipitates transfers from a spinodal-like intertwined structure to a nanoparticle dispersed structure. Previous parametric approaches to predict phase formation rules for high-entropy alloys are unable to describe the phase separation behaviors in the studied alloys. Our findings provide a new route to design medium-entropy alloys and also demonstrate a strategy for designing nanostructured alloys from multicomponent alloy systems through simple variations in non-equiatomic compositions.",The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China.

In order for the somatic/axonal membrane potential to reach action potential threshold, concurrent activation of multiple excitatory synapses is required. Frequently, instead of a simple algebraic summation of synaptic potentials in the soma, different dendritic compartments contribute to the integration of multiple inputs, thus endowing the neuron with a powerful computational ability. Most pyramidal neurons share common functional properties. However, different and sometimes contrasting dendritic integration rules are also observed. In this review, we focus on the dendritic integration of two neighboring pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus: the well-characterized CA1 and the much less understood CA2. The available data reveal that the dendritic integration of these neurons is markedly different even though they are targeted by common inputs at similar locations along their dendrites. This contrasting dendritic integration results in different routing of information flow and generates different corticohippocampal loops.",,,Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences,,,"Action Potentials; Animals; CA1 Region, Hippocampal; CA2 Region, Hippocampal; Dendrites; Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; Humans; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Neural Pathways; Pyramidal Cells; Rats; Receptors, Vasopressin; Synapses",2011-07-28,2011,2011-07-28,2012-01,69,1,75-88,All OA; Green,Article,"Piskorowski, Rebecca A.; Chevaleyre, Vivien","Piskorowski, Rebecca A.

Interviews with ten sperm donors and non-sperm donors yielded 55 reasons for sperm donation in the two settings. These reasons were categorized according to similarity by 14 sperm donors and non-sperm donors. These categorizations were then structured by means of hierarchical cluster analysis. Reasons favouring formal settings included being legally and physically protected, evading paternal feelings or social consequences, and having a simple, standardized procedure in terms of effort and finances. Reasons favouring informal settings related to engagement, the possibility to choose a recipient, lack of rules and regulations, having contact with the donor child, and having an (intimate) bond with the recipient. The overview of reasons identified may help potential sperm donors decide on whether to donate in a formal or informal setting, and may fuel discussions by professionals about the most appropriate conditions and legislation for sperm donation in formal settings.",Declaration of interest: The authors report no declarations of interest.

In this study we addressed the question of whether the interictal spike structure is different between ""typical"" and ""atypical"" BREC patients. Atypical BREC patients are characterized by having other neurological abnormalities in addition to the typical BREC symptoms. This question is of interest given the good prognosis associated with the typical form of BREC. We analyzed data from 12 typical and 12 atypical BREC patients using ten variables to describe spike morphology and topography. The non-parametric method of ""classification and regression trees"" (CART) was used to detect discriminating features and construct a classification rule. In this way the location and amplitude of the spike were found to provide satisfactory discrimination, suggesting that the two groups may be affected by different epileptic processes.

In a parallel manner, the number of core facilities that provide bioinformatics support are also increasing. Notably, the generation of complex large datasets has necessitated the development of bioinformatics support core facilities that aid laboratory scientists with cost-effective and efficient data management, analysis, and interpretation. In this article, we address the challenges-related to communication, good laboratory practice, and data handling-that may be encountered in core support facilities when providing bioinformatics support, drawing on our own experiences working as support bioinformaticians on multidisciplinary research projects. Most importantly, the article proposes a list of guidelines that outline how these challenges can be preemptively avoided and effectively managed to increase the value of outputs to the end user, covering the entire research project lifecycle, including experimental design, data analysis, and management (i.e., sharing and storage). In addition, we highlight the importance of clear and transparent communication, comprehensive preparation, appropriate handling of samples and data using monitoring systems, and the employment of appropriate tools and standard operating procedures to provide effective bioinformatics support.","The authors are supported by various grants.

Our method, referred to as the top-scoring pair(s) (TSP) classifier, is motivated by current technical and practical limitations in using gene expression microarray data for class prediction, for example to detect disease, identify tumors or predict treatment response. Accurate statistical inference from such data is difficult due to the small number of observations, typically tens, relative to the large number of genes, typically thousands. Moreover, conventional methods from machine learning lead to decisions which are usually very difficult to interpret in simple or biologically meaningful terms. In contrast, the TSP classifier provides decision rules which i) involve very few genes and only relative expression values (e.g., comparing the mRNA counts within a single pair of genes); ii) are both accurate and transparent; and iii) provide specific hypotheses for follow-up studies. In particular, the TSP classifier achieves prediction rates with standard cancer data that are as high as those of previous studies which use considerably more genes and complex procedures. Finally, the TSP classifier is parameter-free, thus avoiding the type of over-fitting and inflated estimates of performance that result when all aspects of learning a predictor are not properly cross-validated.",,,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology,,,,2004-08-30,2004,2004-08-30,2004,3,1,1-19,All OA; Green,Article,"Geman, Donald; d'Avignon, Christian; Naiman, Daniel Q.; Winslow, Raimond L.","Geman, Donald (Johns Hopkins University); d'Avignon, Christian (Johns Hopkins University); Naiman, Daniel Q.

Cannon in his ""The wisdom of the body"" (1932) systematically used the engineering vision of regulation. In 1938, Selye enriched this approach by the notion of adaptation energy. This term causes much debate when one takes it literally, as a physical quantity, i.e. a sort of energy. Selye did not use the language of mathematics systematically, but the formalization of his phenomenological theory in the spirit of thermodynamics was simple and led to verifiable predictions. In 1980s, the dynamics of correlation and variance in systems under adaptation to a load of environmental factors were studied and the universal effect in ensembles of systems under a load of similar factors was discovered: in a crisis, as a rule, even before the onset of obvious symptoms of stress, the correlation increases together with variance (and volatility). During 30 years, this effect has been supported by many observations of groups of humans, mice, trees, grassy plants, and on financial time series. In the last ten years, these results were supplemented by many new experiments, from gene networks in cardiology and oncology to dynamics of depression and clinical psychotherapy. Several systems of models were developed: the thermodynamic-like theory of adaptation of ensembles and several families of models of individual adaptation. Historically, the first group of models was based on Selye's concept of adaptation energy and used fitness estimates. Two other groups of models are based on the idea of hidden attractor bifurcation and on the advection-diffusion model for distribution of population in the space of physiological attributes. We explore this world of models and experiments, starting with classic works, with particular attention to the results of the last ten years and open questions.",The work was supported by the University of Leicester and the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation (Project No. 14.Y26.31.0022).,,Physics of Life Reviews,,,"Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Mice; Models, Biological; Thermodynamics",2021-03-17,2021,2021-03-17,2021-07,37,,17-64,All OA; Green,Article,"Gorban, A.N.; Tyukina, T.A.; Pokidysheva, L.I.; Smirnova, E.V.","Gorban, A.N.

Hyperphagia and obesity are characteristics of hypercortisolism. We have therefore asked whether or not leptin levels were elevated in very obese children, and whether or not dexamethasone would increase leptin levels in obese children. A single dose dexamethasone suppression test was performed in ten obese children (5 girls, 5 boys; age 6 to 16 yrs, mean 12 +/- 1, median 12 yrs) to rule out hypercortisolism. Body mass index (BMI) in the ten children was calculated to be 27-45 kg/m2. Venous blood was sampled before dexamethasone was given in the evening and at 9.00 a.m. the following morning. Endogenous cortisol production was suppressed in all patients. Leptin levels, as measured by a newly developed specific radioimmunoassay, were 31.6 +/- 12.9 microg/l, range 19.2-59.9 microg/l before dexamethasone and 39.9 +/- 16.5 microg/l, range 26.3-80.3 microg/l after dexamethasone in the obese children (ANOVA, p = 0.01). Simple regression analysis revealed that serum levels correlated significantly with body mass index (r = 0.82, p < 0.001). Non-obese children (BMI < 27 kg/m2) had leptin levels between 0.1 and 33.3 microg/l, median 2.2 microg/l (N = 713). Girls (5.5 +/- 4.6 microg/l) (N = 401) had significantly higher leptin levels than boys (1.7 +/- 2.1 microg/l (N = 312) (p < 0.0001). We conclude that 1) high serum leptin concentrations are present in obese children. 2) A single dose of dexamethasone significantly increases the high leptin serum levels in these children.

We used molecular examinations to develop a decision tree to predict atypical pathogens with CAP and to examine the prevalence of macrolide resistance in Mycoplasma pneumoniae. We conducted a prospective observational study of patients aged ≥ 18 years who had fever and respiratory symptoms and were diagnosed with CAP in one of two community hospitals between December 2016 and October 2018. We assessed combinations of clinical variables that best predicted atypical pathogens with CAP by classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. Pneumonia was defined as respiratory symptoms and new infiltration recognized on chest X-ray or chest computed tomography. We analyzed 47 patients (21 females, 44.7%, mean age: 47.6 years). Atypical pathogens were detected in 15 patients (31.9%; 12 Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 3 Chlamydophila pneumoniae). Ten patients carried macrolide resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (macrolide resistant rate 83.3%). CART analysis suggested that factors associated with presence of atypical pathogens were absence of crackles, age < 45 years, and LD ≥ 183 U/L (sensitivity 86.7% [59.5, 98.3], specificity 96.9% [83.8, 99.9]). ur simple clinical decision rules can be used to identify primary care patients with CAP that are at risk for atypical pathogens.

Ambitious tree-planting initiatives, many already underway, aim to sequester enormous quantities of carbon to partly compensate for anthropogenic CO2 emissions, which are a major cause of rising global temperatures. However, tree planting that is poorly planned and executed could actually increase CO2 emissions and have long-term, deleterious impacts on biodiversity, landscapes and livelihoods. Here, we highlight the main environmental risks of large-scale tree planting and propose 10 golden rules, based on some of the most recent ecological research, to implement forest ecosystem restoration that maximizes rates of both carbon sequestration and biodiversity recovery while improving livelihoods. These are as follows: (1) Protect existing forest first; (2) Work together (involving all stakeholders); (3) Aim to maximize biodiversity recovery to meet multiple goals; (4) Select appropriate areas for restoration; (5) Use natural regeneration wherever possible; (6) Select species to maximize biodiversity; (7) Use resilient plant material (with appropriate genetic variability and provenance); (8) Plan ahead for infrastructure, capacity and seed supply; (9) Learn by doing (using an adaptive management approach); and (10) Make it pay (ensuring the economic sustainability of the project). We focus on the design of long-term strategies to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises and support livelihood needs. We emphasize the role of local communities as sources of indigenous knowledge, and the benefits they could derive from successful reforestation that restores ecosystem functioning and delivers a diverse range of forest products and services. While there is no simple and universal recipe for forest restoration, it is crucial to build upon the currently growing public and private interest in this topic, to ensure interventions provide effective, long-term carbon sinks and maximize benefits for biodiversity and people.","We thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers for constructive feedback that helped improve this manuscript.

Here we describe a new approach for constraining the viable precursors and formation pathways of highly oxidized organic aerosol, by starting with the oxidized product and considering the possible reverse reactions, using a set of simple chemical rules. The focus of this work is low-volatility oxidized organic aerosol (LV-OOA), determined from factor analysis of aerosol mass spectrometer data. The elemental composition and volatility of the aerosol enable the determination of its position in a three-dimensional chemical space (defined by H/C, O/C, and carbon number) and thus its average chemical formula. Consideration of possible back-reactions then defines the movement taken through this chemical space, constraining potential reaction pathways and precursors. This approach is taken for two highly oxidized aerosol types, an average of LV-OOA factors from ten field campaigns (average formula C10.5H13.4O7.3), and extremely oxidized LV-OOA (from Mexico City, average formula C10H12.1O8.4). Results suggest that potential formation pathways include functionalization reactions that add multiple functional groups per oxidation step, oligomerization of highly oxidized precursors, and, in some cases, fragmentation reactions that involve the loss of small, reduced fragments.","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation, under grant numbers CHE-1012809 and AGS-1056225.

1958,pub.1106319601,10.1017/s0022149x18000767,30141383,,Best practice guidelines for studies of parasite community ecology,"In recent decades, parasite community ecology has produced hundreds of studies on an ever-growing number of host species, and developed into an active sub-discipline of parasitology. However, this growth has been characterized by a lack of standards in the practices used by researchers, with many common approaches being flawed, unjustified or misleading. Here, in the hope of promoting advances in the study of parasite community ecology, I identify some of the most common errors or weaknesses in past studies, and propose ten simple rules for best practice in the field. They cover issues including, among others, taxonomic resolution, proper and justifiable analytical methods, higher-level replication, controlling for sampling effort or species richness, accounting for spatial distances, using experimental approaches, and placing raw data in the public domain. While knowledge of parasite communities has expanded in breadth, with more and more host species being studied, true progress has been very limited with respect to our understanding of fundamental general processes shaping these communities. It is hoped that the guidelines presented here can direct researchers away from the entrenched use of certain approaches flawed in design, analysis or interpretation, by offering a more rigorous and standardized set of practices, and, hopefully, a way forward.","I am grateful to Juan Timi for valuable comments on an earlier draft, and to two anonymous reviewers (one constructive and useful, the other not).",,Journal of Helminthology,,,Animals; Biodiversity; Biota; Ecology; Host Specificity; Host-Parasite Interactions; Parasites; Parasitology,2018-08-24,2018,2018-08-24,2019-01,93,1,8-11,Closed,Article,"Poulin, R.","Poulin, R.

In Ayurveda, Ahara Vidhi (dietary rules) and Vihara (conducts) are described in detail which can be included under the heading of lifestyle. Agnimandya (indigestion) is considered as the root cause of all diseases like diabetes mellitus, obesity etc., which are few among the top ten lifestyle disorders.
AIM: The present study is aimed at establishment of relationship between disturbances in lifestyle and Agnimandya and role of lifestyle modification in correcting the state of Agnimandya.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was carried out on 33 patients diagnosed with Agnimandya having disturbed lifestyle. Patients were divided into two groups with simple random sampling method. In Group A, lifestyle modification was advised with placebo capsules of wheat flour, while in Group B, patients were treated with 2 g of Shatapushpadya Churna for 2 weeks.
RESULTS: Both the groups showed statistically highly significant results on majority of the symptoms of Agnimandya, however, Group A provided better effect than Group B.
CONCLUSION: Lifestyle has definite role in the manifestation and treatment of Agnimandya.","The study was supported by Institute for Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda, Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar, Gujarat.

We conducted a two-sample mendelian randomization analysis to estimate the causality between gut microbiome and HIV infection.MethodsPublicly released genome-wide association studies summary data were collected to perform the mendelian analysis. The GWAS summary data of gut microbiome was retrieved from the MiBioGen consortium, which contains 18 340 samples from 24 cohorts. GWAS summary data of HIV infection was collected from the R5 release of FinnGen consortium, including 357 HIV infected cases and 218 435 controls. The SNPs were selected as instrumental variables according to our selection rules. And SNPs with a F-statistics less than ten were regarded as weak instrumental variables and excluded. Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted by five methods, including inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode. The Cochran’s Q test and MR-Egger intercept test were performed to identify heterogeneity and pleiotropy. Leave-one-out analysis were used to test the sensitivity of the results.ResultsFifteen gut microbiota taxa showed causal effects on HIV infection according to the MR methods. Four taxa were observed to increase the risk of HIV infection, including Ruminococcaceae (OR: 2.468[1.043, 5.842], P: 0.039), RuminococcaceaeUCG005 (OR: 2.051[1.048, 4.011], P: 0.036), Subdoligranulum (OR: 3.957[1.762, 8.887], P < 0.001) and Victivallis (OR: 1.605[1.012, 2.547], P=0.044). Erysipelotrichaceae was protective factor of HIV infection (OR: 0.278[0.106, 0.731], P < 0.001) and Methanobrevibacter was also found to be associated with reduced risk of HIV infection (OR: 0.509[0.265, 0.980], P=0.043). Horizontal pleiotropy was found for Fusicatenibacter (P<0.05) according to the MR-Egger regression intercept analysis. No heterogeneity was detected.ConclusionOur results demonstrate significant causal effects of gut microbiome on HIV infection. These findings facilitate future studies to develop better strategies for HIV prophylaxis through gut microbiome regulation.

SummaryThe risk of a recurrent fragility fracture is high following a first fracture and higher still with more than one prior fracture. This study provides adjustments to FRAX-based fracture probabilities accounting for the number of prior fractures.IntroductionPrior fractures increase subsequent fracture risk. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of the number of prior fractures on the 10-year probability of fracture determined with FRAX®.MethodsThe study used data from the Reykjavik Study fracture register that documented prospectively all fractures at all skeletal sites in a large sample of the population of Iceland. Ten-year probabilities of hip fracture and major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) were determined according to the number of prior osteoporotic fractures over a 20-year interval from the hazards of death and fracture. Fracture probabilities were also computed for a prior osteoporotic fracture irrespective of the number of previous fractures. The probability ratios provided adjustments to conventional FRAX estimates of fracture probability according to the number of prior fractures.ResultsProbability ratios to adjust 10-year FRAX probabilities of a hip fracture and MOF increased with the number of prior fractures but decreased with age in both men and women. Probability ratios were similar in men and women and for hip fracture and MOF. Mean probability ratios according to the number of prior fractures for all scenarios were 0.95, 1.08, 1.21 and 1.35, for 1,2, 3 and 4 or more prior fractures, respectively. Thus, a simple rule of thumb is to downward adjust FRAX-based fracture probabilities by 5% in the presence of a single prior fracture and to uplift probabilities by 10, 20 and 30% with a history of 2, 3 and 4 or more prior fractures, respectively.ConclusionThe probability ratios provide adjustments to conventional FRAX estimates of fracture probability according to the number of prior fractures.",We thank the participants in the Reykjavik Study for their valuable contribution.,,Osteoporosis International,,,Male; Female; Humans; Osteoporotic Fractures; Bone Density; Risk Assessment; Hip Fractures; Probability; Risk Factors,2022-09-26,2022,2022-09-26,2022-12,33,12,2507-2515,Closed,Article,"Kanis, John A.; Johansson, Helena; Harvey, Nicholas C.; Gudnason, Vilmundur; Sigurdsson, Gunnar; Siggeirsdottir, Kristin; Lorentzon, Mattias; Liu, Enwu; Vandenput, Liesbeth; McCloskey, Eugene V.","Kanis, John A.

1906,pub.1129445355,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2020.05.108,32687830,,A Simple Prioritization Change to Lung Transplant Allocation May Result in Improved Outcomes,"BACKGROUND: The lung allocation score (LAS) significantly improved outcomes and wait list mortality in lung transplantation. However, mortality remains high for the sickest wait list candidates despite additional changes to allocation distance. Regulatory considerations of overhauling the current lung allocation system have met significant resistance, and changes would require years to implement. This study evaluates whether a modest change to the current system by prioritization of only high-LAS lung transplant candidates would result in lowered wait list mortality.
METHODS: The Thoracic Simulated Allocation Model was used to evaluate all lung transplant candidates and donor lungs recovered between July 1, 2009 and June 30, 2011. Current lung allocation rules (initial offer within a 250-nautical mile radius for ABO-identical then compatible offers) were run. Allocation was then changed for only patients with an LAS of50 or higher (high-LAS) to be prioritized within a 500-nautical mile radius with no stratification between ABO-identical and compatible offers. Ten iterations of each model were run. Primary end points were wait list mortality and posttransplant 1-year survival.
RESULTS: A total of 6538 wait list candidates and transplant recipients were evaluated per iteration, for a total of 130,760 simulated patients. Compared with current allocation, the adjusted model had a 23.3% decrease in wait list mortality. Posttransplant 1-year survival was minimally affected.
CONCLUSIONS: Without overhauling the entire system, simple prioritization changes to the allocation system for high-LAS candidates may lead to decreased wait list mortality and increased organ use. Importantly, these changes do not appear to lead to clinically significant changes in posttransplant 1-year survival.",The data reported here have been supplied by the Hennepin Healthcare Research Institute (HHRI) as the contractor for the SRTR.

However, one major challenge to enforcing social distancing in public areas is how to perceive people in three dimensions. This paper proposes an innovative pedestrian 3D localization method using monocular images combined with terrestrial point clouds. In the proposed approach, camera calibration is achieved based on the correspondences between 2D image points and 3D world points. The vertical coordinates of the ground plane where pedestrians stand are extracted from the point clouds. Then, using the assumption that the pedestrian is always perpendicular to the ground, the 3D coordinates of the pedestrian's feet and head are calculated iteratively using collinear equations. This allows the three-dimensional localization and height determination of pedestrians using monocular cameras, which are widely distributed in many major cities. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using two different datasets. Experimental results show that the pedestrian localization error of the proposed approach was less than one meter within tens of meters and performed better than other localization techniques. The proposed approach uses simple and efficient calculations, obtains accurate location, and can be used to implement social distancing rules. Moreover, since the proposed approach also generates accurate height values, exclusionary schemes to social distancing protocols, particularly the parent-child exemption, can be introduced in the framework.","We would like to thank Xuesheng Zhao, and Jun Li of College of Geoscience and Surveying Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing) for giving some comments and writing suggestions.

Umbrella reviews are reviews of previously published systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Therefore, they represent one of the highest levels of evidence synthesis currently available, and are becoming increasingly influential in biomedical literature. However, practical guidance on how to conduct umbrella reviews is relatively limited.
METHODS: We present a critical educational review of published umbrella reviews, focusing on the essential practical steps required to produce robust umbrella reviews in the medical field.
RESULTS: The current manuscript discusses 10 key points to consider for conducting robust umbrella reviews. The points are: ensure that the umbrella review is really needed, prespecify the protocol, clearly define the variables of interest, estimate a common effect size, report the heterogeneity and potential biases, perform a stratification of the evidence, conduct sensitivity analyses, report transparent results, use appropriate software and acknowledge the limitations. We illustrate these points through recent examples from umbrella reviews and suggest specific practical recommendations.
CONCLUSIONS: The current manuscript provides a practical guidance for conducting umbrella reviews in medical areas. Researchers, clinicians and policy makers might use the key points illustrated here to inform the planning, conduction and reporting of umbrella reviews in medicine.",This work is supported by a King’s College London Confidence in Concept award (MC_PC_16048) from the Medical Research Council (MRC) to PFP and a Miguel Servet Research Contract (MS14/00041) to JR from the Instituto de Salud Carlos III and the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER).,"This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in thepublic, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.",BMJ Mental Health,,,Guidelines as Topic; Humans; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Statistics as Topic; Systematic Reviews as Topic,2018-07-13,2018,2018-07-13,2018-08,21,3,95,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Fusar-Poli, Paolo; Radua, Joaquim","Fusar-Poli, Paolo (Early Psychosis: Interventions and Clinical-detection (EPIC) Lab, Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King’s College London, London, UK; OASIS Service, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK; Department of Brain and Behavioral Sciences, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy); Radua, Joaquim (Early Psychosis: Interventions and Clinical-detection (EPIC) Lab, Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King’s College London, London, UK; FIDMAG Germanes Hospitalaries, CIBERSAM, Barcelona, Spain; Centre for Psychiatry Research, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden)",,"Fusar-Poli, Paolo (King's College London; South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust; University of Pavia); Radua, Joaquim (King's College London; Fidmag Sisters Hospitallers; Karolinska Institutet)",397,187,17.8,103.38,https://ebmh.bmj.com/content/ebmental/21/3/95.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105570263,42 Health Sciences; 4202 Epidemiology,

As a probe, we used a random DNA fragment (probe 46) from a genomic library of a Foe isolate. This probe contains two different types of sequence, one being repeated and dispersed in the genome ``Palm'', the other being a single-copy sequence. All F. oxysporum isolates from the palm-grove soils were non-pathogenic to oil palm. They all had a simple restriction pattern with one band homologous to the single-copy sequence of probe 46. All Foe isolates were pathogenic to oil palm and they all had complex patterns due to hybridization with ``Palm''. This repetitive sequence reveals that Foe isolates are distinct from the other F. oxysporum palm-grove soils isolates. The sequence can reliably discriminate pathogenic from non-pathogenic oil palm isolates. Based on DNA fingerprint similarities, Foe populations were divided into ten groups consisting of isolates with the same geographic origin. Isolates from Brazil and Ecuador were an exception to that rule as they had the same restriction pattern as a few isolates from the Ivory Coast, suggesting they may originated from Africa.",,,Current Genetics,,,"Fusarium; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Restriction Mapping; Soil Microbiology; Trees",1996-07,1996,,1996-07,30,2,174-180,Closed,Article,"Mouyna, I.; Renard, J.

Motoneurones were examined in which low-intensity p.b.s.t conditioning volleys caused a 5% or greater decrease of gastrocnemius monosynaptic e.p.s.p.s without evidence of long-lasting i.p.s.p.s on superimposed single sweeps. 2. Short constant current pulses were injected into these cells and in twenty-two of twenty-three cases the voltage decay was faster when preceded by the same p.b.s.t. conditioning stimuli which caused a decrease in the Ia e.p.s.p. 3. Comparing these decays to short pulse decays generated in a simple analogue neurone model suggested that after conditioning stimuli a tonic conductance increase had occurred which was located electrotonically remote from the soma in some cases or more diffusely in other cases. 4. Long-lasting i.p.s.p.s were brought out by averaging the baseline following conditioning stimuli in ten of fifteen cases, also suggesting a post-synaptic conductance increase. 5. Averaging the voltage response to long saturating constant current pulses showed a decreased motoneurone input resistance in three of eight cases. 6. The semilogarithmic decay of four of eleven conditioned e.p.s.p.s was more rapid than controls. 7. Although short pulse voltage decay analysis revealed consistent evidence for increased post-synaptic conductance following conditioning stimuli, it was not possible to decide if the location and extent of this conductance increase were sufficient to rule out presynaptic inhibition.",,,The Journal of Physiology,,,"Animals; Cats; Electric Conductivity; Evoked Potentials; Models, Neurological; Motor Neurons; Neural Inhibition; Spinal Cord; Synapses",1980-01,1980,,1980-01,298,1,539-556,All OA; Green,Article,"Carlen, P L; Werman, R; Yaari, Y","Carlen, P L (); Werman, R (); Yaari, Y ()",,"Carlen, P L (); Werman, R (); Yaari, Y ()",31,0,1.68,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1279135,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1039988402,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3209 Neurosciences,

Six of fourteen tumors exhibited loss of heterozygosity of one or more markers on 11p. Ten patients were informative for loci on 13q, and 5 of these 10 exhibited loss of heterozygosity for one or more of the 13q markers. Altogether, 9 of the 14 patients showed loss of a polymorphic allele for one or more loci on either 11p or 13q. A survey of loci on 16 additional chromosomes indicated that the deletions were not due to a general loss of heterozygosity in HCCs. Quantitative densitometry showed that each of the 10 deletions resulted in hemizygosity (no reduplication) of the remaining allele in tumor tissue. In contrast to hereditary embryonal tumors, in which reduplication of the remaining chromosome is the rule, simple deletion appears to be the primary mechanism responsible for the loss of heterozygosity in these adult, nonhereditary HCCs.

We find that such corrections are too large (≃1 GeV) and rule out the significance of the usual confining part Iconf of the BS kernel as obtained by a simple ‘‘covariantization’’ of the instantaneous form implied by the linear potential. This suggests to keep Iconf instantaneous so that the only retardation correction comes from the perturbative part of the kernel.

From a public health point of view it is most relevant to answer the question of whether chemicals in drinking water interact in a way that results in an increased overall response as compared to the sum of the responses to the individual chemicals in the mixture, or indeed in an effect that is simply a summation of the expected effects of the individual chemicals. Present methods for risk assessment of mixtures rely heavily on some form of additivity model, unless data are adequate for a direct risk assessment of the mixture of concern in its entirety. The ""dose-addition"" concept (""simple similar action"") is the most common approach to risk assessment of mixtures and it is applicable over the whole range of exposure levels from low non-toxic to toxic levels when all chemicals in the mixture act in a similar way. However, in toxicity studies at environmentally relevant exposure scenarios the mixtures that meet such conditions are the exception rather than the rule. In that case the ""effect addition"" model has to be followed assuming ""independent joint action"". For these compounds now experimental data have indicated that the results at low exposure levels are probably difficult to predict based on response additivity found at higher dose levels. Thus, although the additivity models are mathematically simple, they require assumptions about the mechanisms of action and the high-to-low dose extrapolation. Therefore, theoretical considerations in risk assessment of chemical mixtures should be verified by simple case studies. Up till now, the number of environmentally relevant mixtures to which a direct risk assessment has been devoted is limited. Even if toxicity data on individual compounds are available, we are still facing the immense problem of extrapolation of findings obtained at relatively high exposure concentration in laboratory animals to man being exposed to (much) lower concentrations. Therefore the prioritization of compounds for further research and the extrapolation to low doses should be considered as key issues in the assessment of possible health risks from exposure to chemical mixtures such as drinking water.",,,Food and Chemical Toxicology,,,"Drug Interactions; Humans; Risk Assessment; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Supply",2000-04,2000,,2000-04,38,1 Suppl,s65-s71,Closed,Article,"Groten, J.P","Groten, J.P (TNO Nutrition and Food Research Institute, Department of Explanatory Toxicology, Utrechtseweg 48, PO Box 360, 3700 AJ Zeist, The Netherlands)",,"Groten, J.P (Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research)",58,3,1.59,5.08,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042708164,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3006 Food Sciences; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences",6 Clean Water and Sanitation

While SMBs are much more efficient than batch operations, they are not widely used for large-scale production because there are two key barriers. The methods for design, optimization, and scale-up are complex for non-ideal systems. The Speedy Standing Wave Design (SSWD) is developed here to reduce these barriers. The productivity (PR) and the solvent efficiency (F/D) are explicitly related to seven material properties and 13 design parameters. For diffusion-controlled systems, the maximum PR or F/D is controlled by two key dimensionless material properties, the selectivity (α) and the effective diffusivity ratio (η), and two key dimensionless design parameters, the ratios of step time/diffusion time and pressure-limited convection time/diffusion time. The optimum column configuration for maximum PR or F/D is controlled by the weighted diffusivity ratio (η/α2). In general, high α and low η/α2 favor high PR and F/D. The productivity is proportional to the ratio of the feed concentration to the diffusion time. Small particles and high diffusivities favor high productivity, but do not affect solvent efficiency. Simple scaling rules are derived from the two key dimensionless design parameters. The separation of acetic acid from glucose in biomass hydrolysate is used as an example to show how the productivity and the solvent efficiency are affected by the key dimensionless material and design parameters. Ten design parameters are optimized for maximum PR or minimum cost in one minute on a laptop computer. If the material properties are the same for different particle sizes and the dimensionless groups are kept constant, then lab-scale testing consumes less materials and can be done four times faster using particles with half the particle size.",AcknowledgmentsThis study was supported by the National Science Foundation (CBET 1403854) and the Hugh and Edna Donnan Dissertation Fellowship (Purdue University).

The molecular structure and spectroscopic parameters determined from the experimental data are presented alongside the results of calculations at the CCSD(T) level. Both experiment and theory are consistent with structures that are nonplanar at equilibrium. The heavy atoms are collinear while the local C(2) axis of the water molecule intersects the axis defined by the heavy atoms at an angle, φ = 40.9(13)° for Cu and φ = 37.4(16)° for Ag. In the zero-point state, each molecule is effectively planar, undergoing rapid inversion between two equivalent structures where φ has equal magnitude but opposite sign. The equilibrium geometry has C(s) symmetry, however. The ab initio calculations confirm that the timescale of this inversion is at least an order of magnitude faster than that of rotation of the molecule in the lowest rotational energy levels.

The long-term accessibility of research data is, therefore, fundamental in the economy of the research production process. However, the availability of data is not sufficient by itself, but also their quality must be verifiable. Measures to ensure reuse and reproducibility need to include the entire research life cycle, from the experimental design to the generation of data, quality control, statistical analysis, interpretation, and validation of the results. Hence, high-quality records, particularly for providing a string of documents for the verifiable origin of data, are essential elements that can act as a certificate for potential users (customers). These records also improve the traceability and transparency of data and processes, therefore, improving the reliability of results. Standards for data acquisition, analysis, and documentation have been fostered in the last decade driven by grassroot initiatives of researchers and organizations such as the Research Data Alliance (RDA). Nevertheless, what is still largely missing in the life science academic research are agreed procedures for complex routine research workflows. Here, well-crafted documentation like standard operating procedures (SOPs) offer clear direction and instructions specifically designed to avoid deviations as an absolute necessity for reproducibility. Therefore, this paper provides a standardized workflow that explains step by step how to write an SOP to be used as a starting point for appropriate research documentation.","This work has been funded by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) CA15110.

In such species, deprotonation of the acid fragment can stabilize the remote radical by tens of kilojoules, or, analogously, formation of a stable radical (by abstraction or homolytic cleavage reactions) increases the acidity of a remote acid by several pKa units. This stabilization can be broadly classified as a new type of polar effect that originates in Coloumbic interactions but, in contrast to standard polar effects, persists in radicals with no charge-separated (i.e., dipole) resonance contributors, is nondirectional, and hence of extremely broad scope. The stabilization upon deprotonation is largest when a highly delocalized radical is combined with an initially less stable anion (i.e., the conjugate base of a weaker acid), and is negligible for highly localized radicals and/or stable anions. The effect is largest in the gas phase and low-polarity solvents but is quenched in water, where the anion is sufficiently stabilized. These simple rules can be employed to design various switchable compounds able to reversibly release radicals in response to pH for use in, for example, organic synthesis or nitroxide-mediated polymerization. Moreover, given its wide chemical scope, this effect is likely to influence the protonation state of many biological substrates under radical attack and may contribute to enzyme catalysis.","The authors acknowledge financial support from the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Free-Radical Chemistry and Biotechnology, an ARC Future Fellowship (to M.L.C.), generous allocations of supercomputing time on the National Facility of the Australian National Computational Infrastructure and helpful discussions with David L.

The following therapeutic measures can be applied to try to influence the activity of the pelvic-floor during voiding: proprioceptive exercises of the pelvic-floor (manual testing), visualization of the electromyographic registration of relaxation and contraction of the pelvic-floor by a curve on a display (relaxation biofeedback), observation of the flow curve during voiding (uroflow biofeedback), learning of an adequate toilet posture in order to reach an optimal relaxation of the pelvic-floor, an individually adapted voiding and drinking schedule to teach the child to deal consciously with the bladder and its function and a number of simple rules for application at home to increase the involvement and motivation of the child. In children however with persisting idiopathic detrusor instability additional therapeutic measures may be necessary to improve present urologic symptoms (incontinence problems, frequency, urge) and to increase bladder capacity. Intravesical biofeedback has been used to stretch the bladder and seems to be useful in case of sensory urge. Recently a less invasive technique, called transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), has been applied on level of S3 with promising results in children with urodynamicaly proven detrusor instability, in which previous therapies have failed.",,,Scandinavian Journal of Urology,,,"Biofeedback, Psychology; Child, Preschool; Exercise Therapy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Infant; Male; Muscle Relaxation; Pelvic Floor; Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation; Treatment Outcome; Urinary Tract Infections; Urination Disorders; Urodynamics",2002-01-01,2002,2009-07-09,2002-01-01,36,4,260-267,Closed,Article,"Paepe, H.

We present a robust computerized scheme to automatically segment freehand sketches into a series of components with specific geometric meaning regardless of whether these are generated online or offline. This task is a necessary first step toward sketch understanding. By exploiting the interpolation / extrapolation characteristic of Radial Basis Functions (RBFs), a greedy algorithm consisting of forward and backward operations is proposed for finding the minimum set of segmentation points that can be used to reconstruct with high fitting accuracy freehand sketches in the form of implicit functions. To obtain segmentation points, a simple angle based rule is used to remove ""bridging"" points that provide a smooth transition between consecutive sketch components. Feasibility of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by a preliminary performance assessment study using ten computer generated drawings. These experiments show that in this dataset sensitivity of the segmentation was higher than 97.5% with a false positive (FP) rate of approximately 25%. The majority of false positive identifications are located on arc regions where a larger number of segmentation points are needed for reconstruction purposes. The primary contribution of this algorithm is that it transforms an ambiguous problem namely, freehand sketch segmentation, into an implicit function fitting operation. Therefore, this proposed approach has several advantages including independence of the actual sketching activity, and the ability for a satisfactory detection of the transition point between a line and an arc or between two arcs.","AcknowledgementThis work is supported in part by grants P50 HL084948 and R01 HL085096 from National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, to the University of Pittsburgh.

However, multihelix systems provide no obvious mechanism of transport and no simple way of distinguishing substrates. The models of lac permease and the Na+/H+ antiporter presented here postulate that beta-structures are involved in the transport of substrate, and in following this postulate arrive at readily understandable mechanisms for transport and for substrate specificity. The percentage of beta-structures necessary for these models is low enough that it is not in conflict with prior physical evidence for secondary structures. Immunological data also cannot rule these beta-structure mechanisms invalid. In lac permease the new model is obtained by formal representation of the C-terminal amino acids 243-405 as beta-strands. This formal representation nets two interchangeable beta-barrels which provide a simple mechanism for sugar transport. The alternating barrel system may comprise as little as 1/5 the entire permease. In one configuration the barrel forms a pocket with hydrogen bonding residues oriented to the outside of the cell. In the other configuration the barrel forms an analogous pocket oriented towards the inside. Six particular amino acids participate in the substrate hydrogen bonding schemes of both forms, providing a mechanism to shuttle lactose from the outside to the inside or vice versa. A trigger for change of forms which could couple the beta-barrel to H(+)-transport is easily devised, and it involves the apparently critical His322-Glu325 charge relay system. The Na+/H+ antiporter can be organized similarly with an interchanging beta-barrel-beta-clamshell structure attached to 7-transmembrane helices. Charged amino acid sidechains form the basis of an ionic shuttle which is analogous to the lactose shuttle. In this case, too, coupling of Na+ transport to H+ transport may be accomplished by a histidine-glutamate charge relay system.",,,Journal of Theoretical Biology,,,"Antiporters; Biological Transport, Active; Carrier Proteins; Escherichia coli Proteins; Hydrogen; Membrane Proteins; Membrane Transport Proteins; Models, Chemical; Monosaccharide Transport Proteins; Sodium; Symporters",1991-05,1991,,1991-05,150,2,239-249,Closed,Article,"Radding, Wilson","Radding, Wilson (Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama 35294, U.S.A.)",,"Radding, Wilson (University of Alabama at Birmingham)",7,0,0.17,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038538188,31 Biological Sciences; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology,
1802,pub.1082778922,,8371595,,Monitoring of adult B-cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia: validation of a simple method for detecting immunoglobulin heavy chain gene clonality.,"Most approaches to demonstrating immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements are relatively laborious for routine follow-up of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Here the use of a simple polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach to monitor ALL disease activity has been validated. In the dilution experiments the method revealed a detection sensitivity 0.5% clonal cells in a background of 99.5% normal cells. To validate the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene PCH (IgH-PCR) in practice, we monitored the disease activity of 26 adult ALL patients showing a B-cell lineage component in immunophenotyping at the diagnosis of the disease. In 18 of those 26 patients, an IgH-PCR product could be demonstrated in the samples taken either at diagnosis or in relapse. These 18 patients were followed with a total of 158 consecutive samples by IgH-PCR. The mean follow-up time for the IgH-PCR-positive patients was 13.6 months (range 4 to 26 months). Eleven of these patients underwent altogether 18 relapses. In nine patients (81.8%), ten relapses (55.6%) could be predicted using the IgH-PCR approach. The mean time of IgH-PCR clonality detection, preceding a cytologic relapse, was 9.1 weeks (range 1.0 to 30.7 weeks). It seems that in three patients the predictive value of the IgH-PCR was remarkable, showing a repetitive positivity in spite of a cytologic remission, even one year prior to the relapse. We find that IgH-PCR provides a straightforward additional tool for monitoring B-cell lineage ALL. Due to the straightforward technical performance the method has low running costs and it is thus suitable for a routine service laboratory. Even if a negative finding in IgH-PCR does not rule out a forthcoming relapse in the patient, a positive finding is a definitive warning signal. All of the patients that showed an IgH-PCR clonality in the follow-up samples relapsed sooner or later.",,,Leukemia,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Bone Marrow; Burkitt Lymphoma; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain; Genes, Immunoglobulin; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Predictive Value of Tests",1993-09,1993,,1993-09,7,9,1459-65,Closed,Article,"Salo, A; Pakkala, S; Jansson, S E; Helminen, P; Palotie, A","Salo, A (Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Helsinki, Finland.); Pakkala, S (); Jansson, S E (); Helminen, P (); Palotie, A ()",,"Salo, A (University of Helsinki); Pakkala, S (); Jansson, S E (); Helminen, P (); Palotie, A ()",7,0,0.34,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1082778922,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology,

Standard training protocols may be partly responsible as they do not satisfy recommendations from psychology. Our main objective was to determine in practice to what extent standard training protocols impact users' motor imagery based BCI (MI-BCI) control performance.
APPROACH: We performed two experiments. The first consisted in evaluating the efficiency of a standard BCI training protocol for the acquisition of non-BCI related skills in a BCI-free context, which enabled us to rule out the possible impact of BCIs on the training outcome. Thus, participants (N = 54) were asked to perform simple motor tasks. The second experiment was aimed at measuring the correlations between motor tasks and MI-BCI performance. The ten best and ten worst performers of the first study were recruited for an MI-BCI experiment during which they had to learn to perform two MI tasks. We also assessed users' spatial ability and pre-training μ rhythm amplitude, as both have been related to MI-BCI performance in the literature.
MAIN RESULTS: Around 17% of the participants were unable to learn to perform the motor tasks, which is close to the BCI illiteracy rate. This suggests that standard training protocols are suboptimal for skill teaching. No correlation was found between motor tasks and MI-BCI performance. However, spatial ability played an important role in MI-BCI performance. In addition, once the spatial ability covariable had been controlled for, using an ANCOVA, it appeared that participants who faced difficulty during the first experiment improved during the second while the others did not.
SIGNIFICANCE: These studies suggest that (1) standard MI-BCI training protocols are suboptimal for skill teaching, (2) spatial ability is confirmed as impacting on MI-BCI performance, and (3) when faced with difficult pre-training, subjects seemed to explore more strategies and therefore learn better.","This research was supported by funding from IdEx Bordeaux.

Using magnetoencephalography, the cortical dynamics of sentence production in Anigram was compared with that in the native tongue from the preparation phase up to the production of the final word. At the preparation phase, a cartoon image with two animals prompted the participants to plan either the corresponding simple sentence (e.g., ""the bear hits the lion"") or a grammar-free list of the two nouns (""the bear, the lion""). For the newly learned language, this stage induced stronger left angular and adjacent inferior parietal activations than for the native language, likely reflecting a higher load on lexical retrieval and STM storage. The preparation phase was followed by a cloze task where the participants were prompted to produce the last word of the sentence or word sequence. Production of the sentence-final word required retrieval of rule-based inflectional morphology and was accompanied by increased activation of the left middle superior temporal cortex that did not differ between the two languages. Activation of the right temporal cortex during the cloze task suggested that this area plays a role in integrating word meanings into the sentence frame. The present results indicate that, after just a few days of exposure, the newly learned language harnesses the neural resources for multiword production much the same way as the native tongue and that the left and right temporal cortices seem to have functionally different roles in this processing.",,,Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience,,,Adult; Brain Mapping; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Learning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetoencephalography; Male; Multilingualism; Parietal Lobe; Speech; Temporal Lobe; Vocabulary; Young Adult,2014-08-01,2014,2014-08-01,2014-08-01,26,8,1721-1735,Closed,Article,"Hultén, Annika; Karvonen, Leena; Laine, Matti; Salmelin, Riitta","Hultén, Annika (Aalto University; Åbo Akademi University); Karvonen, Leena (Aalto University); Laine, Matti (Åbo Akademi University); Salmelin, Riitta (Aalto University)",,"Hultén, Annika (Aalto University; Åbo Akademi University); Karvonen, Leena (Aalto University); Laine, Matti (Åbo Akademi University); Salmelin, Riitta (Aalto University)",9,2,0.27,0.98,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1019912421,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,

Coronal synostosis: Its familial characteristics and associated clinical findings in 109 patients lacking bilateral polysyndactyly or syndactyly,"This paper is the second part of a survey of 370 patients with craniosynostosis. It concerns 109 patients with coronal synostosis, with or without additional suture involvement who lacked polysyndactyly or syndactyly. Bilateral and unilateral coronal synostosis occurred with approximately equal frequency and there was an excess of males in both groups. Multiple suture involvements  was frequent in patients with bilateral synostosis, but was uncommon in those with unilateral involvement. Those patients with bilateral synostosis and additional suture involvement were treated later than those with isolated bilateral synostosis and a possible explanation for this finding is discussed. Forty-seven percent of patients with bilateral synostosis had additional major malformations. Cardiac malformations were significantly more frequent than would be expected by chance. Thirty-five percent of patients with unilateral involvement had major malformations. Twenty-six percent of those with bilateral and ten percent of those with unilateral synostosis were mentally retarded, but retardation was found to be associated either with increased frequency of major malformations or with a complex medical history. Mental retardation is uncommon in simple, uncomplicated coronal synostosis. Twelve of the 104 families showed a positive family history; nine with vertical and three with horizontal transmission. An admixture of unilateral and bilateral suture involvement was the rule, and families with involvement limited to unilateral synostosis did not occur. Certain patterns of characteristic familial minor malformation, particularly of the hands, allow recognition of a number of these familial cases.

The scheme includes four processing modules that (1) segment left and right lung areas, (2) identify airway locations, (3) segment airway walls from neighboring pixels, and (4) compute airway sizes. The scheme uses both a raster scanning and a labeling algorithm complemented by simple classification rules for region size and circularity to automatically search for and identify airway sections of interest. A profile tracking method is used to segment airway walls from neighboring pixels including those associated with dense tissue (i.e., pulmonary arteries) along scanning radial rays. A partial pixel membership method is used to compute airway size. The scheme was tested on ten randomly selected CT studies that included 26 sets of CT images acquired using both low and conventional dose CT examinations with one of four reconstruction algorithms (namely, ""bone,"" ""lung,"" ""soft,"" and ""standard"" convolution kernels). Three image section thicknesses (1.25, 2.5, and 5 mm) were evaluated. The scheme detected a large number of quantifiable airway sections when the CT images were reconstructed using high spatial frequency convolution kernels. The detection results demonstrated a consistent trend for all test image sets in that as airway lumen size increases, on average the airway wall area increases as well and the wall area percentage decreases. The study suggested that CT images reconstructed using high spatial frequency convolution kernels and thin-section thickness were most amenable to automated detection, reasonable segmentation, and quantified assessment when the airways are close to being perpendicular to the CT image plane.",,,Medical Physics,,,"Algorithms; Humans; Lung; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2007-06-14,2007,2007-06-14,2007-07,34,7,2844-2852,Closed,Article,"Zheng, Bin; Leader, Joseph K.; McMurray, Jessica M.; Park, Sang Cheol; Fuhrman, Carl R.; Gur, David; Sciurba, Frank C.","Zheng, Bin (Department of Radiology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213); Leader, Joseph K.

We report the first method to differentiate between the three industrial routes used to produce the precursors ephedrine and pseudoephedrine by measurement of stable isotope ratios of nitrogen (δ(15)N), hydrogen (δ(2)H), and carbon (δ(13)C). Analysis of 782 samples of seized methylamphetamine allowed classification into three groups using k-means clustering or the expectation-maximization algorithm applied to a Gaussian mixture model. By preparation of 30 samples of ephedrine by the ""fully synthetic"" industrial process and measuring their δ(15)N, δ(2)H, and δ(13)C values, we observed that (15)N becomes significantly depleted compared to the methylamine starting material. Conversion of ten ephedrine samples to methylamphetamine showed that this depletion is maintained in the final drug product, of which the δ(15)N, δ(13)C, and δ(2)H values were distinct from those of ephedrine and methylamphetamine samples of a semi-synthetic (fermentation pathway) origin. Combining modeling analysis with the new experiments and published information on the values of δ(2)H gave a definitive assignment of the three model groups, and equations to obtain probabilities for the precursor origin of any new sample. A simple rule of thumb is also presented.

When testing cognition in animals, the simplest paradigms can potentially yield quick results with minimal investment from the experimenter. Although appetitively motivated tasks are generally learnt more slowly than aversively motivated ones, they may be essential for distinguishing the effects of a treatment on learning from its effects on aversive motivation per se. For example, if a treatment improves learning in both types of paradigm, this is better evidence that it affects cognition rather than sensorimotor processes. Rats and mice easily learn position discriminations in a T-maze, especially if multiple cues, such as different objects and floor textures in the goal arms, are provided. To start, the rodent is placed in the maze and it chooses an arm. This Trial 1, however, is the only one on which this arm will be rewarded. From now on, it must always choose the other arm. The rule is simple: for example, always turn left into the arm with diagonal black stripes on the walls and gravel glued to the floor. High levels of correct responding can be achieved within 20–40 trials. The test may therefore be particularly useful with animals of low cognitive ability, such as transgenic mice derived from some 129 or SJL strains. Once the animals are habituated, each trial should take approximately 1 min.

EUS-guided biopsy obtains the best results for lymph nodes, anastomotic relapses and extrinsicz compression as well as for pancreatic tumours. Results in the literature show a global sensitivity of the technique that varies between 76 and 91%, a specificity of 84-100% and an accuracy of 78-94%. Using alcohol injection of the plexus nerves, the coeliac block guided by EUS is a simple technique. It will replace percutaneous access under US or CT scan guidance. Data from the literature show a significant reduction in pain of the order of 85-90% of cases-results that would have been good for percutaneous techniques. The technique of cystoenterostomy guided by EUS allows more accurate drainage of the cysts with a lower risk of perforation and haemorrhage. With regard to haemorrhage it should be emphasized that colour Doppler and power Doppler assessment of the punctures rules out the risk of vascular perforation during puncture but the risk of haemorrhage due to decompression of a vascular lesion in the vicinity of the cyst remains. The new ultrasound echoendoscope EG 38X, with a large working channel (3.8 mm), is now available. This system allows more effective drainage and also enables the placement of cystodigestive stents.",,,Best Practice & Research Clinical Gastroenterology,,,"Biopsy, Needle; Endoscopy; Endosonography; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures; Neoplasm Staging; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Risk Assessment; Stents; Treatment Outcome",2004-02,2004,,2004-02,18,1,183-200,Closed,Article,"Giovannini, M","Giovannini, M (Oncology Unit 1, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, 232 Boulevard Sainte-Marguerite, 13273 Marseille Cedex 9, France; Chief of the Endoscopic Unit)","Giovannini, M (Institute Paoli-Calmettes; Chief of the Endoscopic Unit)","Giovannini, M (Institute Paoli-Calmettes; Chief of the Endoscopic Unit)",20,1,0.32,3.45,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1018615097,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

These subjects were primarily GOLD Class 2 to 4, and had been recently discharged from hospital following a recent exacerbation. The respiration rates were collected using a non-contact radio-frequency biomotion sensor which senses respiratory effort and body movement using a short-range radio-frequency sensor. An adaptive notch filter was applied to the measured signal to determine respiratory rate over rolling 15 s segments. The accuracy of the algorithm was initially verified using ten manually-scored 15 min segments of respiration extracted from overnight polysomnograms. The calculated respiration rates were within 1 breath min(-1) for >98% of the estimates. For the 20 subjects monitored, 11 experienced one or more subsequent exacerbation of COPD (ECOPD) events during the 8 week monitoring period (19 events total). Analysis of the data revealed a significant increase in nocturnal respiration rate (e.g. >2 breath min(-1)) prior to many ECOPD events. Using a simple classifier of a change of 1 breath min(-1) in the mode of the nocturnal respiration rate, a predictive rule showed a sensitivity of 63% and specificity of 85% for predicting an exacerbation within a 5 d window. We conclude that it is possible to collect respiration rates reliably in the home environment, and that the respiration rate may be a potential indicator of change in clinical status.",,,Physiological Measurement,,,"Aged; Female; Housing; Humans; Male; Monitoring, Physiologic; Movement; Pilot Projects; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Radio Waves; Respiratory Rate",2014-11-17,2014,2014-11-17,2014-12-01,35,12,2513-2527,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Ballal, Tarig; Heneghan, Conor; Zaffaroni, Alberto; Boyle, Patricia; de Chazal, Philip; Shouldice, Redmond; McNicholas, Walter T; Donnelly, Seamas C","Ballal, Tarig (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia); Heneghan, Conor (ResMed Sensor Technologies, Clonskeagh, Dublin 4, Ireland); Zaffaroni, Alberto (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia); Boyle, Patricia (Sleep Research Laboratory, St Vincent’s University Hospital, Dublin 4, Ireland); de Chazal, Philip (MARCS Institute, University of Western Sydney, Sydney, Australia); Shouldice, Redmond (ResMed Sensor Technologies, Clonskeagh, Dublin 4, Ireland); McNicholas, Walter T (Sleep Research Laboratory, St Vincent’s University Hospital, Dublin 4, Ireland); Donnelly, Seamas C (Dept of Respiratory Medicine, St Vincent’s University Hospital, Dublin 4, Ireland)",,"Ballal, Tarig (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology); Heneghan, Conor (ResMed Sensor Technologies, Clonskeagh, Dublin 4, Ireland); Zaffaroni, Alberto (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology); Boyle, Patricia (St. Vincent's University Hospital); de Chazal, Philip (Western Sydney University); Shouldice, Redmond (ResMed Sensor Technologies, Clonskeagh, Dublin 4, Ireland); McNicholas, Walter T (St. Vincent's University Hospital); Donnelly, Seamas C (St. Vincent's University Hospital)",16,6,0.59,2.38,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0967-3334/35/12/2513/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1059124142,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3208 Medical Physiology; 40 Engineering; 4003 Biomedical Engineering,

However, it is difficult and laborious to visually identify and count all implanted seeds on the pelvic radiographs within a short time. Therefore, our purpose in this research was to develop an automated method for estimation of the number of implanted seeds based on two-view analysis of pelvic radiographs. First, the images of the seed candidates on the pelvic image were enhanced using a difference of Gaussian filter, and were identified by binarizing the enhanced image with a threshold value determined by multiple-gray level thresholding. Second, a simple rule-base method using ten image features was applied for false positive removal. Third, the candidates for the likely number of a multiply overlapping seed region, which may include one or more seeds, were estimated by a seed area histogram analysis and calculation of the probability of the likely number of overlapping seeds. As a result, the proposed method detected 99.9% of implanted seeds with 0.71 false positives per image on average in a test for training cases, and 99.2% with 0.32 false positives in a validation test. Moreover, the number of implanted seeds was estimated correctly at an overall recognition rate of 100% in the validation test using the proposed method. Therefore, the verification time for the number of implanted seeds could be reduced by the provision of several candidates for the likely number of seeds.",,,Journal of Radiation Research,,,Aged; Automation; Brachytherapy; Humans; Iodine Radioisotopes; Male; Middle Aged; Pelvis; Prostatic Neoplasms; Radiographic Image Enhancement,2012-07-05,2012,2012-07-05,2012-09-01,53,5,742-752,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kawata, Hidemichi; Arimura, Hidetaka; Suefuji, Hiroaki; Ohkura, Sunao; Saida, Yoshifumi; Nashiki, Kazutaka; Hayashida, Kazuya; Kawahara, Tomomi; Ohishi, Ayumu; Hayabuchi, Naofumi","Kawata, Hidemichi (Radiation Therapy Center, Kurume University Hospital, 67, Asahi-machi, Kurume, Fukuoka 830-0011, Japan); Arimura, Hidetaka (Department of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, 3-1-1, Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan); Suefuji, Hiroaki (Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, 67, Asahi-machi, Kurume, Fukuoka 830-0011, Japan); Ohkura, Sunao (Radiation Therapy Center, Kurume University Hospital, 67, Asahi-machi, Kurume, Fukuoka 830-0011, Japan); Saida, Yoshifumi (Radiation Therapy Center, Kurume University Hospital, 67, Asahi-machi, Kurume, Fukuoka 830-0011, Japan); Nashiki, Kazutaka (Radiation Therapy Center, Kurume University Hospital, 67, Asahi-machi, Kurume, Fukuoka 830-0011, Japan); Hayashida, Kazuya (Radiation Therapy Center, Kurume University Hospital, 67, Asahi-machi, Kurume, Fukuoka 830-0011, Japan); Kawahara, Tomomi (Radiation Therapy Center, Kurume University Hospital, 67, Asahi-machi, Kurume, Fukuoka 830-0011, Japan); Ohishi, Ayumu (Radiation Therapy Center, Kurume University Hospital, 67, Asahi-machi, Kurume, Fukuoka 830-0011, Japan); Hayabuchi, Naofumi (Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, 67, Asahi-machi, Kurume, Fukuoka 830-0011, Japan)","Kawata, Hidemichi (Kurume University Hospital)","Kawata, Hidemichi (Kurume University Hospital); Arimura, Hidetaka (Kyushu University); Suefuji, Hiroaki (Kurume University); Ohkura, Sunao (Kurume University Hospital); Saida, Yoshifumi (Kurume University Hospital); Nashiki, Kazutaka (Kurume University Hospital); Hayashida, Kazuya (Kurume University Hospital); Kawahara, Tomomi (Kurume University Hospital); Ohishi, Ayumu (Kurume University Hospital); Hayabuchi, Naofumi (Kurume University)",2,0,0.05,0.38,https://academic.oup.com/jrr/article-pdf/53/5/742/2700776/rrs018.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1033974536,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

A series of repeated dose studies in rats with defined mixtures of chemicals with the same or different target organs revealed that exposure to a combination of chemicals compared with exposure to the individual compounds did not constitute an evidently increased hazard, provided each chemical was administered at a level similar to, or slightly lower than, its own 'No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level'. The results of subacute oral toxicity studies in rats with defined mixtures of nephrotoxicants with similar mode of action underlined the applicability of the additivity assumption for a mixture of chemicals with simple similar action. Safety evaluation of complex chemical mixtures is a challenge that can be tackled as follows: first, identify the (e.g. ten) most risky chemicals in the mixture, and, second, assess the hazard and the potential health risk of the mixture of the most risky chemicals, using procedures developed for defined mixtures. To identify interactions between individual compounds, a most promising testing strategy appeared to be a statistical approach using a fractional two-level factorial design. A challenge for today and the future is to gradually substitute mixture-oriented (real life-oriented) standard setting for (unrealistic) single chemical-oriented standard setting.",,,Toxicology,,,"Administration, Inhalation; Administration, Oral; Aldehydes; Animals; Drug Interactions; Hazardous Substances; Kidney Diseases; Organ Specificity; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Research Design; Risk Assessment; Toxicity Tests; Xenobiotics",1995-12,1995,,1995-12,105,2-3,415-427,Closed,Article,"Feron, V.J.; Groten, J.P.; Jonker, D.; Cassee, F.R.; van Bladeren, P.J.","Feron, V.J.

For this purpose, ten chromatographic models were used and four methods were adopted for their application. The methods were based on (a) the analytical expression of the retention time, provided that this expression is available, (b) the retention times estimated using the Nikitas-Pappa approach, (c) the stepwise approximation, and (d) a simple numerical approximation involving the trapezoid rule for integration of the fundamental equation for gradient elution. For all these methods, Excel VBA macros have been written and implemented using two different platforms; the fitting and the optimization platform. The fitting platform calculates not only the adjustable parameters of the chromatographic models, but also the significance of these parameters and furthermore predicts the analyte elution times. The optimization platform determines the gradient conditions that lead to the optimum separation of a mixture of analytes by using the Solver evolutionary mode, provided that proper constraints are set in order to obtain the optimum gradient profile in the minimum gradient time. The performance of the two platforms was tested using experimental and artificial data. It was found that using the proposed spreadsheets, fitting, prediction, and optimization can be performed easily and effectively under all conditions. Overall, the best performance is exhibited by the analytical and Nikitas-Pappa's methods, although the former cannot be used under all circumstances.",The project is realized in the framework of the Operational Program “Education and Lifelong learning” and is co-funded by the European Union (European Social Fund) and National Resources as part of the Grant Standardizing Metabolomics (Excellence II: Metabostandards 5204).,,Journal of Chromatography A,,,"Chromatography, Liquid; Computer Simulation; Models, Theoretical; Software",2015-04-02,2015,2015-04-02,2015-05,1395,,109-115,Closed,Article,"Fasoula, S.; Zisi, Ch.; Gika, H.; Pappa-Louisi, A.; Nikitas, P.","Fasoula, S.

Further, our method simplifies the quantification and statistical analysis of white matter tracts on large diffusion MRI databases. This work reflects the careful syntactical definition of major white matter fiber tracts in the human brain based on a neuroanatomist’s expert knowledge. The framework is based on a novel query language with a near-to-English textual syntax. This query language makes it possible to construct a dictionary of anatomical definitions that describe white matter tracts. The definitions include adjacent gray and white matter regions, and rules for spatial relations. This novel method makes it possible to automatically label white matter anatomy across subjects. After describing this method, we provide an example of its implementation where we encode anatomical knowledge in human white matter for ten association and 15 projection tracts per hemisphere, along with seven commissural tracts. Importantly, this novel method is comparable in accuracy to manual labeling. Finally, we present results applying this method to create a white matter atlas from 77 healthy subjects, and we use this atlas in a small proof-of-concept study to detect changes in association tracts that characterize schizophrenia.","This work has been supported by NIH grants: R01MH074794, R01MH092862, P41RR013218, R01MH097979, P41EB015902, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA and Swedish Research Council (VR) Grant 2012-3682.

This randomized crossover study aimed to assess the effects of approaches, practitioners’ experience and learning sequences on the accuracy of single tooth implantation via digital registration method. No similar study was found.MethodsThis in vitro randomized crossover study enrolled 60 novice students (Group S) and 10 experienced instructors (Group I). Sixty students were randomly and evenly assigned to two groups (Group SA and SB). In Group SA, 30 students first performed single molar implant on a simulation model freehand (Group SAFH), and then with a CAD/CAM surgical guide (Group SASG). In Group SB, another 30 students first performed guided (Group SBSG) and then freehand (Group SBFH). Ten instructors were also divided into Group IAFH/IASG (n = 5) and IBSG/IBFH (n = 5) following the same rules. The accuracy of implant placement was assessed by the coronal and apical distance (mm) and angular (°) deviations using the digital registration method. T tests and nonparametric tests were used to compare the results among different groups of approaches, experience and sequences.ResultsFor students, the coronal and apical distance and the angular deviations were significantly lower in surgical guide group than freehand group in total and in learning freehand first subgroup, but for learning surgical guide first subgroup the apical distance deviation showed no significant difference between two approaches. For students, the angular deviation of freehand group was significantly lower in learning surgical guide first group than learning freehand first group.For instructors, the coronal and apical distance and angular deviations showed no significant difference between two approaches and two sequences.For freehand approach, the coronal and apical distance and the angular deviations were significantly higher in student group than instructor group, while not significantly different between two groups for surgical guide approach.ConclusionsFor novices, using a surgical guide for the first implant placement may reduce the potential deviations compared with freehand surgery, and may reach a comparable accuracy with that of specialists. For simple single molar implantation, the surgical guide may not be significantly helpful for experienced specialists.","The authors would like to express the appreciation to Dentspy Sirona for kindly providing us with the dental implants used in this in vitro study.

Three wild perennial Hordeum species, including H. bogdanii, H. brevisubulatum, and H. violaceum, have been used as forage and for grassland ecological restoration in high-altitude areas in recent years. To date, the degree of interspecies sequence variation in the three Hordeum species within existing gene pools is still not well-defined. Herein, we sequenced and assembled chloroplast (cp) genomes of the three species. The results revealed that the cp genome of H. bogdanii showed certain sequence variations compared with the cp genomes of the other two species (H. brevisubulatum and H. violaceum), and the latter two were characterized by a higher relative affinity. Parity rule 2 plot (PR2) analysis illuminated that most genes of all ten Hordeum species were concentrated in nucleotide T and G. Numerous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and insertion/deletion (In/Del) events were detected in the three Hordeum species. A series of hotspots regions (tRNA-GGU ~ tRNA-GCA, tRNA-UGU ~ ndhJ, psbE ~ rps18, ndhF ~ tRNA-UAG, etc.) were identified by mVISTA procedures, and the five highly polymorphic genes (tRNA-UGC, tRNA-UAA, tRNA-UUU, tRNA-UAC, and ndhA) were proved by the nucleotide diversity (Pi). Although the distribution and existence of cp simple sequence repeats (cpSSRs) were predicted in the three Hordeum cp genomes, no rearrangement was found between them. A similar phenomenon has been found in the cp genome of the other seven Hordeum species, which has been published so far.

The surgeon must carry out a complete clinical examination in order to rule out any orbital pathologies responsible for eyelid pockets.
METHODS: Study of ten patients who have consulted in the oculopalpebral surgery department of La Fondation Ophtalmologique de Rothschild for cosmetic surgery of the eyelid pockets and in whom an underlying pathology was diagnosed.
RESULTS: The clinical examination allows to look for signs of alarms, such as medical history, unilateral involvement, pain and the presence of exophthalmos. These should lead to perform orbital imaging and surgical biopsy if an orbital mass has been identified for histological analysis which will make the diagnosis. We identified four cases of orbital lymphoma, one foreign body granuloma, chronic bilateral dacryoadenitis, sarcoidosis involvement, AAPOX syndrom, cavernous hemangioma, and simple fatty hernia.

Use of an individual's own thumbprint area as a fraction of their total hand surface area was evaluated to assess potential utility in hand burn evaluation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten health professionals used an ink-covered dominant thumb pulp to cover the surfaces of their own non-dominant hand using the contralateral thumb. Thumbprints were assessed on the web spaces, sides of digits and dorsum and palm beyond the distal wrist crease. Hand surface area was estimated using the Banerjee and Sen method, and thumbprint ellipse area calculated to assess correlation.
RESULTS: Mean estimated total hand surface area was 390.0cm2±SD 51.5 (328.3-469.0), mean thumbprint ellipse area was 5.5cm2±SD 1.3 (3.7-8.4), and mean estimated print number was 73.5±SD 11.0 (range 53.1-87.8, 95% CI 6.8). The mean observed number of thumbprints on one hand was 80.1±SD 5.9 (range 70.0-88.0, 95% CI 3.7), χ2=0.009. The combined mean of digital prints was 42, comprising a mean of two prints each on volar, dorsal, radial and ulnar digit surfaces, except volar middle and ring (3 prints each). Palmar prints were 15 (11-19), dorsal 15 (11-19), ulnar palm border 3, first web space 2, and second, third and fourth web spaces one each. Using the surface of the palm alone, excluding digits, as 0.5% of total body surface area, the area of one thumbprint was approximated as 1/30th of 1%.

1654,pub.1083077167,,9117914,,Is colour flow imaging needed to exclude clinically significant valvular regurgitation in adult patients undergoing transthoracic echocardiography?,"OBJECTIVE: To establish whether clinically significant aortic and mitral valvular regurgitation can be excluded in adult patients undergoing transthoracic echocardiography without using colour flow imaging.
SETTING: Sunnybrook Health Science Centre, a tertiary referral centre with full cardiovascular services affiliated with the University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario.
DESIGN: Logistic regression models were developed from a retrospective review of 14,051 unselected consecutive echocardiograms from 1991 through 1994. The dependent variable was more than mild aortic or mitral valvular regurgitation. Independent variables included age, sex and various functional and structural measures obtained during routine two-dimensional echocardiography. The negative predictive values and sensitivity of the models were estimated.
INTERVENTION: The number of patients correctly classified by these models, as well as the proportion for whom the colour flow imaging did not add to the baseline echocardiogram, was determined. Nonparametric bootsrapping was used to obtain confidence intervals for these statistics.
MAIN RESULTS: Ten models were developed, with negative predictive values ranging from 96.2% to 100%. Incorporation of such decision aids into the software of echocardiographic machinery would help echocardiographers to rule out significant aortic or mitral regurgitant lesions. In practices where colour flow imaging is routinely employed, 40% fewer procedures could be performed.
CONCLUSIONS: Models based on simple demographic and two-dimensional echocardiographic variables can reliably exclude significant valvular regurgitation and could potentially reduce the volumes and costs of colour flow imaging. Given the widespread diffusion of colour Doppler imaging, the models may also be helpful to avoid misinterpretation of flow imaging results, by defining subgroups in whom the prior probability of significant aortic or mitral regurgitation is extremely low.",,,Canadian Journal of Cardiology,,,"Aged; Algorithms; Aortic Valve Insufficiency; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Mitral Valve Insufficiency; Predictive Value of Tests; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Ultrasonography, Doppler, Color",1997-03,1997,,1997-03,13,3,261-9,Closed,Article,"Cox, J L; Chan, B; Anderson, G M; Sykora, K; Morgan, C D; Joyner, C; Naylor, C D","Cox, J L (Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, North York, Ontario. coxjl@is.dal.ca); Chan, B (); Anderson, G M (); Sykora, K (); Morgan, C D (); Joyner, C (); Naylor, C D ()",,"Cox, J L (Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences); Chan, B (); Anderson, G M (); Sykora, K (); Morgan, C D (); Joyner, C (); Naylor, C D ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1083077167,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

Current screening guidelines are based on simple, categorical rules developed for populations of patients. Although personalized diabetes risk calculators have been created, none are designed to predict current glycemic status using structured data commonly available in electronic health records (EHRs).
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this project was to create a mathematical equation for predicting the probability of current elevations in HbA1c (≥5.7%) among patients with no history of hyperglycemia using readily available variables that will allow integration with EHR systems.
METHODS: The reduced model was compared head-to-head with calculators created by Baan and Griffin. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to calculate the bias-adjusted prediction accuracy of the new model. Statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.2.5 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing) using the rms (Regression Modeling Strategies) package.
RESULTS: The final model to predict an elevated HbA1c based on 22,635 patient records contained the following variables in order from most to least importance according to their impact on the discriminating accuracy of the model: age, body mass index, random glucose, race, serum non-high-density lipoprotein, serum total cholesterol, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and smoking status. The new model achieved a concordance statistic of 0.77 which was statistically significantly better than prior models. The model appeared to be well calibrated according to a plot of the predicted probabilities versus the prevalence of the outcome at different probabilities.
CONCLUSIONS: The calculator created for predicting the probability of having an elevated HbA1c significantly outperformed the existing calculators. The personalized prediction model presented in this paper could improve the efficiency of HbA1c screening initiatives.","We would like to acknowledge the data extraction and statistical assistance of the Wake Forest Clinical and Translational Science Institute, which is supported by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health (grant number UL1TR001420).

Since each cell has thousands of mtDNA copies, clustered into nucleoids of five to ten mtDNA molecules each, determining the effects of a given mtDNA mutation and their connection with disease phenotype is not straightforward. It has been postulated that heteroplasmy (coexistence of mutated and wild-type DNA) follows simple probability rules dictated by the random distribution of mtDNA molecules at the nucleoid level. This model has been used to explain how mutation levels correlate with the onset of disease phenotype and loss of cellular function. Nonetheless, experimental evidence of heteroplasmy at the nucleoid level is scarce. Here, we report a new method to determine heteroplasmy of individual mitochondrial particles containing one or more nucleoids. The method uses capillary cytometry with laser-induced fluorescence detection to detect individual mitochondrial particles stained with PicoGreen, which makes it possible to quantify the mtDNA copy number of each particle. After detection, one or more particles are collected into polymerase chain reaction (PCR) wells and then subjected to real-time multiplexed PCR amplification. This PCR strategy is suitable to obtain the relative abundance of mutated and wild-type mtDNA. The results obtained here indicate that individual mitochondrial particles and nucleoids contained within these particles are not heteroplasmic. The results presented here suggest that current models of mtDNA segregation and distribution (i.e., heteroplasmic nucleoids) need further consideration.FigureSetup for collection of individual mitochondrial particles into PCR vials after their laser-induced fluorescence detection (image in the background).

The key element in sample preparation was the consecutive cleanup with high-performance liquid chromatography of initially native and subsequently acetylated steroids. This strategy enabled sufficient cleanup off all target analytes for determination of their respective D/H values. Ten steroids (11beta-hydroxyandrosterone, 5alpha-androst-16-en-3alpha-ol, pregnanediol, androsterone, etiocholanolone, testosterone, epitestosterone, 5alpha-androstan-3alpha,17beta-diol, 5beta-androstan-3alpha,17beta-diol and dehydroepiandrosterone) were measured from a single urine specimen. Depending on the biological background, the determination limit for all steroids ranged from 10 to 15 ng/mL for a 20 mL specimen. The method was validated by application of linear mixing models on each steroid and covered repeatability and reproducibility. The specificity of the procedure was ensured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of the sample using equivalent chromatographic conditions to those employed in the GC/TC/IRMS measurement. Within the sample preparation, no isotopic fractionation was observed, and no amount-dependent shift of the D/H ratios during the measurement was noticed. Possible memory effects occurring during IRMS measurements were corrected by applying a simple rule of proportion. In order to determine the naturally occurring D/H ratios of all implemented steroids, a population of 18 male subjects was analyzed. Relevant mean Delta values among selected steroids were calculated which allowed us to study the metabolic pathways and production sites of all the implemented steroids with additional consideration of the corresponding (13)C/(12)C ratios.","This project was funded by the Federal Ministry of the Interior of the Federal Republic of Germany and by the Manfred Donike Institute (MDI), Cologne.",,Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry,,,Adult; Deuterium; Doping in Sports; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Humans; Hydrogen; Male; Middle Aged; Steroids; Substance Abuse Detection; Young Adult,2009-05-21,2009,2009-05-21,2009-07-15,23,13,1917-1926,Closed,Article,"Piper, Thomas; Thevis, Mario; Flenker, Ulrich; Schänzer, Wilhelm","Piper, Thomas (Institute of Biochemistry, German Sport University Cologne, Am Sportpark Müngersdorf 6, 50933 Cologne, Germany); Thevis, Mario (Institute of Biochemistry, German Sport University Cologne, Am Sportpark Müngersdorf 6, 50933 Cologne, Germany); Flenker, Ulrich (Institute of Biochemistry, German Sport University Cologne, Am Sportpark Müngersdorf 6, 50933 Cologne, Germany); Schänzer, Wilhelm (Institute of Biochemistry, German Sport University Cologne, Am Sportpark Müngersdorf 6, 50933 Cologne, Germany)","Piper, Thomas (German Sport University Cologne)","Piper, Thomas (German Sport University Cologne); Thevis, Mario (German Sport University Cologne); Flenker, Ulrich (German Sport University Cologne); Schänzer, Wilhelm (German Sport University Cologne)",31,0,0.98,2.2,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043305862,34 Chemical Sciences; 3401 Analytical Chemistry,

For different reasons, each of them is sometimes detectable in a crime stain for which autosomal typing fails. But they also present special problems, including a fundamental mathematical one: When a rare haplotype is shared between suspect and crime scene, how strong is the evidence linking the two? Assume a reference population sample is available which contains n-1 haplotypes. The most interesting situation as well as the most common one is that the crime scene haplotype was never observed in the population sample. The traditional tools of product rule and sample frequency are not useful when there are no components to multiply and the sample frequency is zero. A useful statistic is the fraction κ of the population sample that consists of ""singletons"" - of once-observed types. A simple argument shows that the probability for a random innocent suspect to match a previously unobserved crime scene type is (1-κ)/n - distinctly less than 1/n, likely ten times less. The robust validity of this model is confirmed by testing it against a range of population models. This paper hinges above all on one key insight: probability is not frequency. The common but erroneous ""frequency"" approach adopts population frequency as a surrogate for matching probability and attempts the intractable problem of guessing how many instances exist of the specific haplotype at a certain crime. Probability, by contrast, depends by definition only on the available data. Hence if different haplotypes but with the same data occur in two different crimes, although the frequencies are different (and are hopelessly elusive), the matching probabilities are the same, and are not hard to find.","AcknowledgmentsI am indebted to Terry Speed whose broad hint in pointing me to several key references [9,18,21] years ago suggest that he anticipated the main idea of this paper.

Many studies have demonstrated that diarrhoea under protease inhibitors and nelfinavir in particular are of a low grade severity, occurring usually at the onset of therapy and are responsible for discontinuation of treatment in less than 2% of cases.

In addition, uptake per unit of root is faster in the nutrient-rich zone. These are often thought of as compensatory responses. The extra surface area and faster uptake from the localized supply offset the inability of the rest of the root system to contribute to nutrient acquisition. This is the picture obtained from a few, well-known studies of young cereals. But is it supported by all the evidence that is available? This review assesses how various attributes respond to localized supplies of nutrients. The attributes are: root growth and development; uptake rates; nutrient contents; root;shoot interactions; and whole-plant growth. The nutrients considered are K, NH4 + , NO3 - and P. The experiments reviewed used techniques ranging from solution cultures to field studies. Most used as controls plants that were amply and uniformly supplied with the nutrient; some used plants uniformly deprived of the nutrient. One third of the measurements of root growth showed little or no response to a localized nutrient supply. Many others did, and the general tendency was for a stimulation of growth in a nutrient-rich zone to be mirrored by a suppression of growth elsewhere. Responses varied with time, species and nutrient. The response of a root system to locally available nutrients can be predicted in general terms. But the precise degree and direction of growth cannot. Simple rules of root development sometimes apply. But these cannot account for many other observations of development that do not follow any simple rule. Uptake per unit of root was usually up to c. three-fold faster when roots of nutrient-deprived plants were supplied locally. Exceptionally, increases of five- to ten-fold were measured. Generally, this increase was related inversely to the fraction of the root system with access to the nutrient. But within particular studies that relation did not hold. Root:shoot ratio usually increased or hardly changed in locally supplied plants. Their nutrient content usually declined more than growth. On average, therefore, the nutrient was less concentrated in the tissues of a locally supplied plant. This may indicate the diversion or mobilization of nutrients from potential storage pools to supplement the amounts taken up from the localized supply. An exception to this was for N in the one C4 species studied, Zea mays. When comparing these attributes, the growth of whole plants was least affected by a non-uniform supply of nutrients, and least variable. This is circumstantial evidence that some of the responses did compensate partially for non-uniform supplies of nutrients.

Clinical decision making requires knowledge, experience and analytical/non-analytical types of decision processes. As clinicians progress from novice to expert, research indicates decision-making becomes less reliant on foundational biomedical knowledge and more on previous experience. In this study, we investigated how knowledge and experience were reflected in terms of differences in neural areas of activation. Novice and expert clinicians diagnosed simple or complex (easy, hard) cases while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected. Our results highlight key differences in the neural areas activated in novices and experts during the clinical decision-making process. fMRI data were collected from ten second year medical students (novices) and ten practicing gastroenterologists (experts) while they diagnosed sixteen (eight easy and eight hard) clinical cases via multiple-choice questions. Behavioral data were collected for diagnostic accuracy (correct/incorrect diagnosis) and time taken to assign a clinical diagnosis. Two analyses were performed with the fMRI data. First, data from easy and hard cases were compared within respective groups (easy > hard, hard > easy). Second, neural differences between novices and experts (novice > expert, expert > novice) were assessed. Experts correctly diagnosed more cases than novices and made their diagnoses faster than novices on both easy and hard cases (all p’s < 0.05). Time taken to diagnose hard cases took significantly longer for both novices and experts. While similar neural areas were activated in both novices and experts during the decision making process, we identified significant hemispheric activation differences between novice and expert clinicians when diagnosing hard clinical cases. Specifically, novice clinicians had greater activations in the left anterior temporal cortex and left ventral lateral prefrontal cortex whereas expert clinicians had greater activations in the right dorsal lateral, right ventral lateral, and right parietal cortex. Hemispheric differences in activation were not observed between novices and experts while diagnosing easy clinical cases. While clinical decision-making engaged the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in both novices and experts, interestingly we observed expertise related differences in the regions and hemispheres of PFC activation between these groups for hard clinical cases. Specifically, in novices we observed activations in left hemisphere neural regions associated with factual rule-based knowledge, whereas in experts we observed right hemisphere activation in neural regions associated with experiential knowledge. Importantly, at the neural level, our data highlight differences in so called type 2 clinical decision-making processes related to prior knowledge and experience.",,,Advances in Health Sciences Education,,,"Adult; Brain Mapping; Clinical Competence; Clinical Decision-Making; Female; Gastroenterology; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Physicians; Students, Medical; Time Factors",2015-11-03,2015,2015-11-03,2016-12,21,5,921-933,Closed,Article,"Hruska, Pam; Hecker, Kent G.; Coderre, Sylvain; McLaughlin, Kevin; Cortese, Filomeno; Doig, Christopher; Beran, Tanya; Wright, Bruce; Krigolson, Olav","Hruska, Pam (Department of Community Health Sciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada); Hecker, Kent G.

Yet, current theoretical approaches to the problems, based largely on compilations of band structures for various latice configurations, have not yielded simple rules relating structural motifs to band gaps. We show that the band gap of substitutional AlAs/GaAs lattices can be usefully expanded in terms of a hierarchy of contributions from real-space ‘‘atomic figures’’ (pairs, triplets, quadruplets) detemined from first-principles band-structure calculations. Pair figures (up to fourth neighbors) and three-body figures are dominant. In analogy with similar cluster expansions of the total energy, this permits a systematic search among all lattice configurations for those having ‘‘special’’ band gaps. This approach enables the design of substitutional systems with certain band-gap properties by assembling atomic figures. As an illustration, we predict that the [01¯2]-oriented (AlAs)1/(GaAs)4/(AlAs)1/(GaAs)2 superlattice has the largest band gap among all Al0.25Ga0.75As lattices with a maximum of ten cations per unit cell.",,,Physical Review B,,,,1991-10-15,1991,1991-10-15,1991-10-15,44,16,8672-8684,Closed,Article,"Magri, R.; Zunger, Alex","Magri, R.

1559,pub.1040202194,10.1006/jmbi.1998.2530,10047495,,A theoretical approach towards the identification of cleavage-determining amino acid motifs of the 20s proteasome11Edited by R. Huber,"Hitherto the mechanisms controlling the selective cleavage of peptide bonds by the 20 S proteasome have been poorly understood. The observation that peptide bond cleavage may eventually occur at the carboxyl site of either amino acid residue rules out a simple control of cleavage preferences by the P1 residue alone. Here, we follow the rationale that the presence of specific cleavage-determining amino acids motifs (CDAAMs) around the scissile peptide bond are required for the attainment of substrate conformations susceptible to cleavage. We present an exploratory search for these putative motifs based on empirical regression functions relating the cleavage probability for a given peptide bond to some selected side-chain properties of the flanking amino acid residues. Identification of the sequence locations of cleavage-determining residues relative to the scissile bond and of their optimal side-chain properties was carried out by fitting the cleavage probability to (binary) experimental observations on peptide bond cleavage gathered among a set of seven different peptide substrates with known patterns of proteolytic degradation products. In this analysis, all peptide bonds containing the same residue in the P1 position were assumed to be cleaved by the same active sites of the proteasome, and thus to be under control of the same CDAAMs. We arrived at a final set of ten different CDAAMs, accounting for the cleavage of one to five different groups of peptide bonds with an overall predictive correctness of 93 %. The CDAAM is composed of two to four ""anchor"" positions preferentially located between P5 and P5' around the scissile bond. This implies a length constraint for the usage of cleavage sites, which could considerably suppress the excision of shorter fragments and thus partially explain for the observed preponderance of medium-size cleavage products.",,,Journal of Molecular Biology,,,"Amino Acid Sequence; Binding Sites; Cysteine Endopeptidases; Eukaryotic Cells; Histocompatibility Antigens Class I; Kinetics; Models, Theoretical; Molecular Sequence Data; Multienzyme Complexes; Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex; Protein Conformation; Regression Analysis; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid",1999-03,1999,,1999-03,286,4,1251-1265,Closed,Article,"Holzhütter, Hermann-Georg; Frömmel, Cornelius; Kloetzel, Peter-Michael","Holzhütter, Hermann-Georg (Institute of Biochemistry Medical Faculty of the Humboldt-University (Charité), Monbijoustr. 2A, Berlin-D 10117, Germany); Frömmel, Cornelius (Institute of Biochemistry Medical Faculty of the Humboldt-University (Charité), Monbijoustr. 2A, Berlin-D 10117, Germany); Kloetzel, Peter-Michael (Institute of Biochemistry Medical Faculty of the Humboldt-University (Charité), Monbijoustr. 2A, Berlin-D 10117, Germany)","Holzhütter, Hermann-Georg (Institute of Biochemistry Medical Faculty of the Humboldt-University (Charité), Monbijoustr. 2A, Berlin-D 10117, Germany)","Holzhütter, Hermann-Georg (Institute of Biochemistry Medical Faculty of the Humboldt-University (Charité), Monbijoustr. 2A, Berlin-D 10117, Germany); Frömmel, Cornelius (Institute of Biochemistry Medical Faculty of the Humboldt-University (Charité), Monbijoustr. 2A, Berlin-D 10117, Germany); Kloetzel, Peter-Michael (Institute of Biochemistry Medical Faculty of the Humboldt-University (Charité), Monbijoustr. 2A, Berlin-D 10117, Germany)",115,3,1.83,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040202194,31 Biological Sciences; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology,

The frequency with which an alteration occurs might reflect its ability to increase cancer cell growth, or alternatively, enhanced instability of a locus may increase the frequency with which it is found to be aberrant in tumors, regardless of oncogenic impact. Here we've addressed this on a genome-wide scale for cancer-associated focal deletions, which are known to pinpoint both tumor suppressor genes (tumor suppressors) and unstable loci. Based on DNA copy number analysis of over one-thousand human cancers representing ten different tumor types, we observed five loci with focal deletion frequencies above 5%, including the A2BP1 gene at 16p13.3 and the MACROD2 gene at 20p12.1. However, neither RNA expression nor functional studies support a tumor suppressor role for either gene. Further analyses suggest instead that these are sites of increased genomic instability and that they resemble common fragile sites (CFS). Genome-wide analysis revealed properties of CFS-like recurrent deletions that distinguish them from deletions affecting tumor suppressor genes, including their isolation at specific loci away from other genomic deletion sites, a considerably smaller deletion size, and dispersal throughout the affected locus rather than assembly at a common site of overlap. Additionally, CFS-like deletions have less impact on gene expression and are enriched in cell lines compared to primary tumors. We show that loci affected by CFS-like deletions are often distinct from known common fragile sites. Indeed, we find that each tumor tissue type has its own spectrum of CFS-like deletions, and that colon cancers have many more CFS-like deletions than other tumor types. We present simple rules that can pinpoint focal deletions that are not CFS-like and more likely to affect functional tumor suppressors.","This work was supported by NIH grants CA124648 and RC2CA148532.

Only analytes that have a single pK(a) are considered. In the buffer mobile phase used for their elution, their dissociation may, under certain conditions, cause a significant pH perturbation during the passage of the band. Two consecutive injections (3.3 and 10 microL) of each one of three sample solutions (0.5, 5, and 50 mM) of ten compounds were injected on five C(18)-bonded packing materials, including the 5 microm Xterra-C(18) (121 A), 5 microm Gemini-C(18 )(110 A), 5 microm Luna-C(18)(2) (93 A), 3.5 microm Extend-C(18 )(80 A), and 2.7 microm Halo-C(18) (90 A). The mobile phase was an aqueous solution of methanol buffered at a constant (W)(W)pH of 6, with a phosphate buffer. The total concentration of the phosphate groups was constant at 50 mM. The methanol concentration was adjusted to keep all the retention factors between 1 and 10. The compounds injected were phenol, caffeine, 3-phenyl 1-propanol, 2-phenyl butyric acid, amphetamine, aniline, benzylamine, p-toluidine, procainamidium chloride, and propranololium chloride. Depending on the relative values of the analyte pK(a) and the buffer solution pH, these analytes elute as the neutral, the cationic, or the anionic species. The influence of structural parameters such as the charge, the size, and the hydrophobicity of the analytes on the shape of its overloaded band profile is discussed. Simple but general rules predict these shapes. An original adsorption model is proposed that accounts for the unusual peak shapes observed when the analyte is partially dissociated in the buffer solution during its elution.",,,Journal of Separation Science,,,"Adsorption; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Ions; Models, Chemical; Molecular Structure; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Solutions; Thermodynamics",2008-11-10,2008,2008-11-10,2008-12,31,21,3657-3682,Closed,Article,"Gritti, Fabrice; Guiochon, Georges","Gritti, Fabrice (Department of Chemistry, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA); Guiochon, Georges ()",,"Gritti, Fabrice (University of Tennessee at Knoxville); Guiochon, Georges ()",21,0,0.79,1.41,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030906645,34 Chemical Sciences; 3401 Analytical Chemistry,

The last decade has seen a number of advances in the development of reliable systems for classifying proteins. Of particular interest has been the exploration of new methods for extracting features from a protein that enhance classification for a given problem. Most methods developed to date, however, have been evaluated in only one or two application areas. Methods have not been explored that generalize well across a number of application areas and datasets. The aim of this study is to find a general method, or an ensemble of methods, that works well on different protein classification datasets and problems. Towards this end, we evaluate several feature extraction approaches for representing proteins starting from their amino acid sequence as well as different feature descriptor combinations using an ensemble of classifiers (support vector machines). In our experiments, more than ten different protein descriptors are compared using nine different datasets. We develop our system using a blind testing protocol, where the parameters of the system are optimized using one dataset and then validated using the other datasets (and so on for each dataset). Although different stand-alone classifiers work well on some datasets and not on others, we have discovered that fusion among different methods obtains a good performance across all the tested datasets, especially when using the weighted sum rule. Included in our feature descriptor combinations is the introduction of two new descriptors, one based on wavelets and the other based on amino acid groups. Using our system, both outperform their standard implementations. We also consider as a baseline the simple amino acid composition (AC) and dipeptide composition (2G), since they have been widely used for protein classification.

Following immune-mediated damage the beta-cell fate depends on several genes up- or down-regulated in parallel and/or sequentially. Based on the information obtained by the analysis of several microarray experiments of beta-cells exposed to pro-apoptotic conditions (e.g. double stranded RNA (dsRNA) and cytokines), we have developed a spotted rat oligonucleotide microarray, the APOCHIP, containing 60-mer probes for 574 genes selected for the study of beta-cell apoptosis.ResultsThe APOCHIP was validated by a combination of approaches. First we performed an internal validation of the spotted probes based on a weighted linear regression model using dilution series experiments. Second we profiled expression measurements in ten dissimilar rat RNA samples for 515 genes that were represented on both the spotted oligonucleotide collection and on the in situ-synthesized 25-mer arrays (Affymetrix GeneChips). Internal validation showed that most of the spotted probes displayed a pattern of reaction close to that predicted by the model. By using simple rules for comparison of data between platforms we found strong correlations (rmedian= 0.84) between relative gene expression measurements made with spotted probes and in situ-synthesized 25-mer probe sets.ConclusionIn conclusion our data suggest that there is a high reproducibility of the APOCHIP in terms of technical replication and that relative gene expression measurements obtained with the APOCHIP compare well to the Affymetrix GeneChip. The APOCHIP is available to the scientific community and is a useful tool to study the molecular mechanisms regulating beta-cell apoptosis.","This work was supported by a grant from the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International to Decio L.

Whole genome sequencing technologies increased the potential number of tested variants to tens of millions. The more tests are performed, the smaller P-value is required to be deemed significant. However, a small P-value is not equivalent to small chances of a spurious finding and significance thresholds may fail to serve as efficient filters against false results. While the Bayesian approach can provide a direct assessment of the probability that a finding is spurious, its adoption in association studies has been slow, due in part to the ubiquity of P-values and the automated way they are, as a rule, produced by software packages. Attempts to design simple ways to convert an association P-value into the probability that a finding is spurious have been met with difficulties. The False Positive Report Probability (FPRP) method has gained increasing popularity. However, FPRP is not designed to estimate the probability for a particular finding, because it is defined for an entire region of hypothetical findings with P-values at least as small as the one observed for that finding. Here we propose a method that lets researchers extract probability that a finding is spurious directly from a P-value. Considering the counterpart of that probability, we term this method POFIG: the Probability that a Finding is Genuine. Our approach shares FPRP's simplicity, but gives a valid probability that a finding is spurious given a P-value. In addition to straightforward interpretation, POFIG has desirable statistical properties. The POFIG average across a set of tentative associations provides an estimated proportion of false discoveries in that set. POFIGs are easily combined across studies and are immune to multiple testing and selection bias. We illustrate an application of POFIG method via analysis of GWAS associations with Crohn's disease.","This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

The method overcomes some of the present limitations in using peptide intensity data for class prediction for problems such as the detection of a disease, disease prognosis, or for predicting treatment response. Data analysis is particularly challenging in these situations due to sample size (typically tens) being much smaller than the large number of peptides (typically thousands). Methods based upon high dimensional statistical models, machine learning or other complex classifiers generate decisions which may be very accurate but can be complex and difficult to interpret in simple or biologically meaningful terms. A classification scheme, called ProtPair, is presented that generates simple decision rules leading to accurate classification which is based on measurement of very few proteins and requires only relative expression values, providing specific targeted hypotheses suitable for straightforward validation.ResultsProtPair has been tested against clinical data from 21 patients following a bone marrow transplant, 13 of which progress to idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). The approach combines multiple peptide pairs originating from the same set of proteins, with each unique peptide pair providing an independent measure of discriminatory power. The prediction rate of the ProtPair for IPS study as measured by leave-one-out CV is 69.1%, which can be very beneficial for clinical diagnosis as it may flag patients in need of closer monitoring. The “top ranked” proteins provided by ProtPair are known to be associated with the biological processes and pathways intimately associated with known IPS biology based on mouse models.ConclusionsAn approach to biomarker discovery, called ProtPair, is presented. ProtPair is based on the differential expression of pairs of peptides and the associated proteins. Using mass spectrometry data from “bottom up” proteomics methods, functionally related proteins/peptide pairs exhibiting co-ordinated changes expression profile are discovered, which represent a signature for patients progressing to various disease conditions. The method has been tested against clinical data from patients progressing to idiopthatic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) following a bone marrow transplant. The data indicates that patients with improper regulation in the concentration of specific acute phase response proteins at the time of bone marrow transplant are highly likely to develop IPS within few weeks. The results lead to a specific set of protein pairs that can be efficiently verified by investigating the pairwise abundance change in independent cohorts using ELISA or targeted mass spectrometry techniques. This generalized classifier can be extended to other clinical problems in a variety of contexts.",This work is supported in part by the Case Western Reserve University/Cleveland Clinic CTSA (Grant Number UL1 RR024989 including a supplement to support T1 research) from the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) to MRC.,,BMC Bioinformatics,,,Algorithms; Biomarkers; Classification; Disease Progression; Early Diagnosis; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Peptides; Pneumonia; Prognosis; Proteins; Proteomics; Syndrome,2012-08-07,2012,2012-08-07,2012-12,13,1,191,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kaur, Parminder; Schlatzer, Daniela; Cooke, Kenneth; Chance, Mark R","Kaur, Parminder (Case Center for Proteomics and Bioinformatics, Case Western Reserve University, 44106, Cleveland, OH, USA); Schlatzer, Daniela (Case Center for Proteomics and Bioinformatics, Case Western Reserve University, 44106, Cleveland, OH, USA); Cooke, Kenneth (Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospitals, 44106, Cleveland, OH, USA); Chance, Mark R (Case Center for Proteomics and Bioinformatics, Case Western Reserve University, 44106, Cleveland, OH, USA)","Kaur, Parminder (Case Western Reserve University)","Kaur, Parminder (Case Western Reserve University); Schlatzer, Daniela (Case Western Reserve University); Cooke, Kenneth (University Hospitals of Cleveland); Chance, Mark R (Case Western Reserve University)",5,1,0.1,0.4,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/1471-2105-13-191,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034570085,31 Biological Sciences; 3102 Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,

In order to comprehend the mechanism of induction we have cloned and sequenced the chicken calbindin-D28K gene. The gene spans some 18.5 kilobases (kb) of chromosomal DNA from the putative Cap site to the polyadenylation site of the 2.8 kb mRNA. It is split into 11 coding exons by 10 intervening sequences. The promoter region of this gene is markedly G + C-rich (60-80%) extending from -225 to +400. Within this region we find 70 CpG dinucleotides, four G-C boxes, and numerous known promoter regulatory signals. These putative regulatory signals include a TATA box (ATAAATA) at -30 and a CAT box (CCAAT) at -326. Ten additional variant CAT boxes are found in the upstream promoter region (-218 to -770) of this gene. Furthermore we have identified a glucocorticoid-like responsive element at -410 (TCTACACACTGTTCC) and this element overlaps a metal responsive element (TGCACTC) and a variant CAT box (CCAAAT) and juxtaposes an enhancer-like core element (AAATGGT) on its 3'-side. In addition, the calbindin-D28K promoter is composed of a variety of simple repeated sequences, some of which are components of putative regulatory signals. All splice junctions were found to conform to the GT-AG rule. A consensus sequence of the 5'-splice junction reads AG/GTAAG-TTATA. A consensus sequence of the 3'-splice site consists of two elements: a pyrimidine track (mainly T) followed by ACAG/G-T. A two-dimensional model of calbindin-D28K was constructed which projects the existence of 6 alpha-helix-loop-alpha-helix regions characteristic of calcium binding domains. The 3'-end of the gene consists of a single large (2039 base pair) uninterrupted exon, an organizational feature common to other members of the calcium binding protein gene family which include calmodulin, parvalbumin, Spec I, myosin light chains, etc. Another feature common to the gene family is the presence of the repeated sequence ATTT or TTTA located in the 3'-untranslated exons. These simple repeat sequences could be involved in regulating mRNA degradation by serving as a ribonuclease recognition signal.",,,Endocrinology,,,"Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Bacteriophage lambda; Base Sequence; Calbindins; Calcium; Chickens; DNA, Recombinant; Exons; Introns; Molecular Sequence Data; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Polymorphism, Genetic; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Conformation; RNA, Messenger; S100 Calcium Binding Protein G",1988-04,1988,,1988-04,2,4,355-67,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Minghetti, P P; Cancela, L; Fujisawa, Y; Theofan, G; Norman, A W","Minghetti, P P (Department of Biochemsitry, University of California, Riverside 92521.); Cancela, L (); Fujisawa, Y (); Theofan, G (); Norman, A W ()",,"Minghetti, P P (University of California, Riverside); Cancela, L (); Fujisawa, Y (); Theofan, G (); Norman, A W ()",58,0,2.04,,https://academic.oup.com/mend/article-pdf/2/4/355/9088534/mend0355.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1064330256,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

Adding the use of PUD to physical examination could lead to an incremental benefit.
AIM: We assessed whether the use of PUD in the context of physical examination can reduce the prescription of additional tests when used by physicians in different clinical settings.
METHODS: We conducted a cohort impact study in four hospital medical wards, one gastroenterological outpatient clinic, and 90 general practices in the same geographical area. The study involved 135 physicians who used PUD, after a short predefined training course, to examine 1962 consecutive patients with one of 10 diagnostic hypotheses: ascites, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, urinary retention, urinary stones, gallstones, biliary-duct dilation, splenomegaly, abdominal mass, abdominal aortic aneurysm. According to the physicians' judgment, PUD examination could rule out or in the diagnostic hypothesis or require further testing; the concordance with the final diagnosis was assessed. The main outcome was the proportion of cases in which additional tests were required after PUD. The PUD diagnostic accuracy was assessed in patients submitted to further testing.
FINDINGS: The 1962 patients included 37% in-patients, 26% gastroenterology outpatients, 37% from general practices. Further testing after PUD examination was deemed unnecessary in 63%. Only 5% of patients with negative PUD not referred for further testing were classified false negatives with respect to the final diagnosis. In patients undergoing further tests, the sensitivity was 91%, and the specificity 83%.
CONCLUSIONS: After a simple and short training course, a PUD examination can be used in addition to a physical examination to improve the answer to ten common clinical questions concerning in- and outpatients, and can reduce the need for further testing.","This study was approved and funded by Lombardy Regional Council Italy (DGR IX/001137 23.12.2010).

The treatment depends upon persistence and severity of symptoms. For hemorrhoids of II and III grade the rubber band ligation may be therapeutic. Our aim is to report the outcomes of rubber band ligation of hemorrhoids, with a follow up of 6 months.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 patients underwent rubber band ligation for symptomatic hemorrhoids (grade II and III) without prolapse, between June 2012 and June 2014. All patients underwent plug test to rule out presence of rectal mucosal prolapse and were classified according to PATE classification (1). Each hemorrhoid was ligated with one rubber band through a ligator. All patients were evaluated immediately at the end of the procedure, after ten days and six months after the treatment. Patient's demographic and operative data were collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: The mean patients age was 47.6±12.3 years (range 24-72). All procedures were performed without complications. Before rubber band ligation, 42 patients had rectal bleeding, 38 had perineal discomfort and 27 had itching. Ten days after the treatment, 12 patients presented self-limited rectal bleeding, but 10 of these had more hemorrhoids and underwent a second rubber band ligation. No patients complained perineal discomfort, and 8 patients had itching; 78% and 16% of patients respectively, experienced feeling of a foreign body inside the canal anal and anal pain. After 6 months, only 13 patients were occasionally symptomatic: 4 patients had rectal bleeding, 2 had perineal discomfort and 4 had itching. Three more patients presented both perineal discomfort and hitching. None had the feeling of a foreign body in anal canal or anal pain.
CONCLUSIONS: Rubber band ligation is an efficacious, cost-effective and simple treatment for the second and third degree hemorrhoids without rectal mucosal prolapsed.

The extent to which nonhuman animals can gain information by reading the cues of others is often tested by evaluating responses to human gestures, such as a point, and less often evaluated by examining responses to conspecific cues. We tested whether ten brown capuchin monkeys (Cebus [Sapajus] apella) were able to use cues from monkeys and a pointing cue from a human to obtain hidden rewards. A monkey could gain access to a reward hidden in one of two locations by reading a cue from a conspecific (e.g., reaching) or a human pointing. We then tested whether they could transfer this skill from monkeys to humans, from humans to monkeys, and from one conspecific to another conspecific. One group of monkeys was trained and tested using a conspecific as the cue-giver and was then tested with a human cue-giver. The second group of monkeys was trained and tested with a human cue-giver and was then tested with a monkey cue-giver. Monkeys that were successful with a conspecific cue-giver were also tested with a novel conspecific cue-giver. Monkeys learned to use a human point and conspecific cues to obtain rewards. Monkeys that had learned to use the cues of a conspecific to obtain rewards performed significantly better than expected by chance when they were transferred to the cues of a novel conspecific. Monkeys that learned to use a human point to obtain rewards performed significantly better than expected by chance when tested while observing conspecific cues. Some evidence suggested that transferring between conspecific cue-givers occurred with more facility than transferring across species. Results may be explained by simple rules of association learning and stimulus generalization; however, spontaneous flexible use of gestures across conspecifics and between different species may indicate capuchins can generalize learned social cues within and partially across species.","The primate facility was supported by Bucknell University.

Due to the use of specialized sub-languages in the medical domain, manual construction of semantic resources that accurately reflect language use is both costly and challenging, often resulting in low coverage. Although models of distributional semantics applied to large corpora provide a potential means of supporting development of such resources, their ability to isolate synonymy from other semantic relations is limited. Their application in the clinical domain has also only recently begun to be explored. Combining distributional models and applying them to different types of corpora may lead to enhanced performance on the tasks of automatically extracting synonyms and abbreviation-expansion pairs.ResultsA combination of two distributional models – Random Indexing and Random Permutation – employed in conjunction with a single corpus outperforms using either of the models in isolation. Furthermore, combining semantic spaces induced from different types of corpora – a corpus of clinical text and a corpus of medical journal articles – further improves results, outperforming a combination of semantic spaces induced from a single source, as well as a single semantic space induced from the conjoint corpus. A combination strategy that simply sums the cosine similarity scores of candidate terms is generally the most profitable out of the ones explored. Finally, applying simple post-processing filtering rules yields substantial performance gains on the tasks of extracting abbreviation-expansion pairs, but not synonyms. The best results, measured as recall in a list of ten candidate terms, for the three tasks are: 0.39 for abbreviations to long forms, 0.33 for long forms to abbreviations, and 0.47 for synonyms.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that ensembles of semantic spaces can yield improved performance on the tasks of automatically extracting synonyms and abbreviation-expansion pairs.

For example, the Top Scoring Pair (TSP) method seeks to find pairs of genes so that the probability of the reversal of the relative ranking of the expression levels of the genes in the two classes is maximized. The computational cost of finding a q-tuple of genes that scores highest under a given metric is O(Gq), where G is the total number of genes. This cost is often problematic or prohibitive in practice (even for q=2), as the number of genes G is often in the order of tens of thousands.
METHODS: In this paper, we show that this computational cost can be significantly reduced by excluding from consideration genes whose behavior is almost identical in the two classes and therefore their inclusion in any q-tuple is rather non-informative. Our criterion for the exclusion of genes is supported by a statistically robust metric, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the corresponding Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. By filtering out genes whose AUC value is below a user-chosen threshold, as determined by a procedure that we describe in the paper, dramatic reductions in the run times are obtained while maintaining the same classification accuracy.
RESULTS: We have experimentally verified the gains of this approach on several case studies involving ovarian, colon, leukemia, breast and prostate cancers, and diffuse large b-cell lymphoma.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is not only faster (for example, we observed an average 78.65% reduction over the run time of TSP) while maintaining the same classification accuracy, but it can even result in better classification accuracy due to its inherent ability to avoid the so-called ""pivot"" (non-informative) genes that may intrude in q-tuples chosen otherwise.",,,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,,,Gene Expression Profiling; Genetic Testing; Humans; Microarray Analysis; Neoplasms; ROC Curve,2019-01-12,2019,2019-01-12,2019-03,170,,69-80,Closed,Article,"Khamesipour, Alireza; Kagaris, Dimitri","Khamesipour, Alireza (ECE Dept., Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, IL 62901, USA.); Kagaris, Dimitri (ECE Dept., Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, IL 62901, USA.

DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort.
SETTING: Large acute National Health Service hospital in London, UK.
PARTICIPANTS: All medical admissions from the emergency department between 10 August 2020 and 4 November 2020 with a valid SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result.
INTERVENTIONS: Medical admissions were triaged as likely, possible or unlikely COVID-19 based on clinical criteria. Patients triaged as possible COVID-19 underwent FebriDx lateral flow assay on capillary blood, and those positive for myxovirus resistance protein A (a host response protein) were managed as likely COVID-19.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity and predictive values) of the algorithm and the FebriDx assay using SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs as the reference standard.
RESULTS: 4.0% (136) of 3443 medical admissions had RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19. Prevalence of COVID-19 was 46% (80/175) in those triaged as likely, 4.1% (50/1225) in possible and 0.3% (6/2033) in unlikely COVID-19. Using a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR reference standard, clinical triage had sensitivity of 96% (95% CI 91% to 98%) and specificity of 61.5% (95% CI 59.8% to 63.1%), while the triage algorithm including FebriDx had sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 87% to 96%) and specificity of 86.4% (95% CI 85.2% to 87.5%). While 2033 patients were deemed not to require isolation using clinical criteria alone, the addition of FebriDx to clinical triage allowed a further 826 patients to be released from isolation, reducing the need for isolation rooms by 9.5 per day, 95% CI 8.9 to 10.2. Ten patients missed by the algorithm had mild or asymptomatic COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: A triage algorithm including the FebriDx assay had good sensitivity and was useful to 'rule-out' COVID-19 among medical admissions to hospital.","We would like to acknowledge all the clinical staff at Northwick Park Hospital who cared for the patients involved in this study.

1441,pub.1151951772,10.1021/acs.accounts.2c00471,36251058,,Ethanol in Aqueous Solution Studied by Microjet Photoelectron Spectroscopy and Theory,"By combining results and analysis from cylindrical microjet photoelectron spectroscopy (cMJ-PES) and theoretical simulations, we unravel the microscopic properties of ethanol-water solutions with respect to structure and intermolecular bonding patterns following the full concentration scale from 0 to 100% ethanol content. In particular, we highlight the salient differences between bulk and surface. Like for the pure water and alcohol constituents, alcohol-water mixtures have attracted much interest in applications of X-ray spectroscopies owing to their potential of combining electronic and geometric structure probing. The water mixtures of the two simplest alcohols, methanol and ethanol, have generated particular attention due to their delicate hydrogen bonding networks that underlie their structural and thermodynamic properties. Macroscopically ethanol-water seems to mix very well, however microscopically this is not true. The aberrant thermodynamics of water-alcohol mixtures have been suggested to be caused by energy differences of hydrogen bonding between water-water, alcohol-alcohol and alcohol-water molecules. These networks may perturb the local character of the interaction between X-rays and matter, calling for analysis that go beyond the normally applied local selection and building block rules and that can combine the effects of light-matter, intra- and intermolecular interactions. However, despite decades of ongoing research there are still controversies of the precise nature of hydrogen bonding networks that underlie the mixing of these simple molecules. Our combined analysis indicates that at low concentration ethanol molecules form a film at the surface since ethanol at the surface can expose its hydrophobic part to the vacuum retaining its two (or three) possible hydrogen bonds, while water at the surface cannot retain all its four possible hydrogen bonds. Thus, ethanol at the surface becomes energetically favorable. Ethanol molecules show a tilting angle variation of the C-C axis with respect to the surface normal as large as 60° at very low concentration. In bulk, around ca. ten %, the ethanol oxygen atoms tend to make a third acceptor hydrogen bond to water molecules. At ca. 20 %, there is a U-shaped change in the CH3 to CH2OH binding energy (BE) shift indicating the presence of ring-like agglomerates called clathrate structures. At the surface, between 5 and 25%, ethanol forms a closely packed layer with the smallest C-C tilting angle variation down to ∼20°. Above 25% and below the azeotrope at the surface, ethanol shows an increase in the tilting angle variation, while at very high ethanol concentrations water tends to move to the surface so giving a microscopic explanation of the azeotrope effect. This migration is connected to the presence of longer (shorter) ethanol chains in the bulk (surface). A brief comparison with discussions and predictions from other spectroscopic techniques is also given. We emphasize the execution of an integrated approach that combines molecular structural dynamics with quantum predictions of the core electronic chemical shift, so establishing a protocol with considerable interpretative as well as predictive power for cMJ-PES measurements. We believe that this protocol can valorize cMJ-PES for studies of properties of other alcohol mixtures as well as of binary solutions in general.","A.N.d.B. acknowledges support from FAPESP (the Sao Paulo Research Foundation, process number 2017/11986-5) and Shell and the strategic importance of the support given by ANP (Brazil’s National Oil, Natural Gas and Biofuels Agency) through the R and D levy regulation.

All pairwise combinations of helix parameters are compared by linear regression analysis, in a search for internal relationships as well as correlations with base sequence. The primary conclusions are: (1) Three-center hydrogen bonds between base-pairs occur frequently in the major groove at C-C, C-A, A-A and A-C steps, but are less convincing at C-C and C-T steps in the minor groove. The requirements for large base-pair propeller are (1) that the base-pair should be A.T rather than G.C, and (2) that it be involved in a major groove three-center hydrogen bond with the following base-pair. Either condition alone is insufficient. Hence, a large propeller is expected at the leading base-pair of A-A and A-C steps, but not at A-T, T-A, C-A or C-C steps. (2) A systematic and quantitative linkage exists between helix variables twist, rise, cup and roll, of such strength that the rise between base-pairs can hardly be described as an independent variable at all. Two typical patterns of behavior are observed at steps from one base-pair to the next: high twist profile (HTP), characterized by high twist, low rise, positive cup and negative roll, and low twist profile (LTP), marked by low twist, high rise; negative cup and positive roll. Examples of HTP are steps G-C, G-A and Y-C-A-R, where Y is pyrimidine and R is purine. Examples of LTP steps are C-G, G-G, A-G and C-A steps other than Y-C-A-R. (3) The minor groove is especially narrow across the two base-pairs of the following steps: A-T, T-A, A-A and G-A. (4) In general, base step geometry cannot be correlated solely with the bases that define the step in question; the two flanking steps also must be taken into account. Hence, local helix structure must be studied in the context, not of two base-pairs: A-B, but of four: x-A-B-y. Calladine's rules, although too simple in detail, were correct in defining the length of sequence over which a given perturbation is expressed. Whereas ten different two-base steps are possible, allowing for the identity of complementary sequences, there are 136 different four-base steps. Only 33 of these 136 four-base steps are represented in the decamer and dodecamer structures solved to date, and hence it is premature to try to set up detailed structural algorithms. (5) The sugar-phosphate backbone chains of B-DNA place strong limits on sequence-induced structural variation, damping down most variables within four or five base-pairs, and preventing purine-purine anti-anti mismatches from causing bulges in the double helix. Hence, although short-range sequence-induced deformations (or deformability) are observed, long-range deformations propagated down the helix are not to be expected.",,,Journal of Molecular Biology,,,Base Composition; Base Sequence; DNA; Hydrogen Bonding; Molecular Sequence Data; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides; Regression Analysis,1991-01,1991,,1991-01,217,1,201-214,Closed,Article,"Yanagi, Kazunori; Privé, Gilbert G.; Dickerson, Richard E.","Yanagi, Kazunori (Molecular Biology Institute Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry University of California, Los Angeles Los Angeles, CA 90024, U.S.A.; Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics University of California, Los Angeles Los Angeles, CA 90024, U.S.A.); Privé, Gilbert G.

1423,pub.1055151646,10.1021/ar700091k,18281947,,Structural Diversity in Expanded Porphyrins,"Inspired by the chemistry of porphyrins, in the last decade, a new research area where porphyrin analogues such as expanded, isomeric, and contracted porphyrins have been synthesized, and their chemistry has been exploited extensively. Expanded porphyrins are macrocyclic compounds where pyrrole or heterocyclic rings are connected to each other through meso carbon bridges. Depending on the number of pyrrole rings in conjugation or the number of double bonds linking the four pyrrole rings expanded porphyrins containing up to 64 pi electrons are reported in the literature. The interest in these systems lies in their potential applications as anion binding agents, as photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy (PDT), in antisensing applications, as MRI contrasting agents, and more recently, as material for nonlinear optical application. Expanded porphyrins containing more than four pyrrole or heterocyclic rings, such as sapphyrin (five pyrrole), rubyrin (six pyrrole), heptaphyrin (seven pyrrole), and octaphyrin (eight pyrrole), are reported in the literature. Furthermore, substituents on expanded porphyrins can be attached either at the meso carbons or at beta-pyrrole positions. beta-substituted expanded porphyrins generally adopt normal structure where all the pyrrole nitrogens point inward in the cavity 1, while the meso-substituted expanded porphyrins exhibit normal 2, inverted 3, fused 4, confused 5, and figure eight 6 conformations. The conformation of expanded porphyrin is dependent on the nature of the linkage of the heterocyclic rings, the nature and the number of the heteroatoms present in the cavity, and the state of protonation. It is possible to change one conformation to another by varying temperature or by simple chemical modification, such as protonation by acids. An understanding of the structure-function correlation in expanded porphyrins is an important step for designing these molecules for their potential applications. In this context, even though several meso aryl expanded porphyrins are reported in literature, there is no comprehensive understanding of structural diversity exhibited by them. In this Account, an attempt has been made to provide a systematic understanding of the conditions and circumstances that lead to various conformations and structures. Specifically, the structural diversities exhibited by five pyrrolic macrocycles to ten pyrrolic macrocycles are covered in this Account. In pentapyrrolic systems, sapphyrins, N-fused, and N-confused pentaphyrins are described. It has been shown that the positions of the heteroatom affect the conformation and in turn the aromaticity. In hexapyrrolic systems, rubyrins and hexaphyrins are covered. The conformation of core-modified rubyrins was found to be dependent on the number and nature of the heteroatom present inside the core. Further, in the hexapyrrolic systems, an increase in the number of meso carbons from four (rubyrin) to six (hexaphyrin) increases the conformational flexibility, where different types of conformations are observed upon going from free base to protonated form. Heptapyrrolic and octapyrrolic expanded porphyrins also exhibit rich structural diversity. Octaphyrins are known to exhibit figure eight conformation, where the macrocycle experiences a twist at the meso carbon, losing aromatic character. By suitable chemical modification, it is possible to avoid the twist, and planar 34 pi core-modified octaphyrins have been reported that show aromatic character and obey the (4 n + 2) Hückel rule. The structural diversity exhibited by nine pyrrolic macrocycles (nonaphyrins) and ten pyrrolic macrocycles (decaphyrins) are also described.","The work summarized in this Account was supported by grants to T.K.C. from Department of Science and Technology (J.

This study was conducted to identify an anatomical landmark on the lateral surface of the head that corresponds to the midpoint of the sellar floor at the level of sphenoidal rostrum. This point, lined up with the nostril, simulates the surgical path and facilitates the transnasal access to the sella turcica. Four adult, formalin-fixed and silicon-injected cadaveric heads, and ten dried skulls were used for laboratory dissection. The heads and skulls were sectioned along the midline; and the spheno-sellar point, corresponding to the midpoint of the sellar floor at the level of sphenoid rostrum, was determined. The spheno-sellar point was plotted on the lateral surface of the skull, and its position measured relative to the external acoustic meatus. Linking the spheno-sellar point with the nostril created the spheno-nostril line. This line represents the surgical path to be taken for direct access to the sphenoid rostrum, and was used to align the cadaveric heads as in surgery. The endonasal transsphenoidal approach was then utilized in one hundred and two adult patients with sellar lesions, using the spheno-sellar point and the spheno-nostril line as the superficial landmarks to guide the approach. The results of this clinical experience are summarized. The spheno-sellar point was found to be located an average of 40.1 mm (SD+/-2.9 mm) anterior and 23.3 mm (SD+/-3.2 mm) superior to the external acoustic meatus. The spheno-nostril line represents the straight surgical path to the sphenoidal rostrum. This landmark was used in 102 correlative transnasal surgeries for sellar lesions of adult patients, and has allowed an easy and straightforward access to the sella. In only 3 cases with poor pneumatisation of the sphenoid sinus (presellar type), the actual location of the surgical instruments had to be confirmed by fluoroscopy. The application of the spheno-sellar point and the spheno-nostril line is a fast, reliable and very simple way to facilitate transsphenoidal surgery, and their use may avoid complications associated with misdirection of this approach. Its use may be limited in cases of poor pneumatisation of the sphenoid sinus, where fluoroscopic guidance could be necessary as a rule.",,,British Journal of Neurosurgery,,,Adult; Cadaver; Humans; Nasal Cavity; Neurosurgical Procedures; Pituitary Neoplasms; Sella Turcica; Sphenoid Bone; Sphenoid Sinus,2009-01,2009,2009-07-21,2009-01,23,3,282-286,Closed,Article,"Campero, Álvaro; Socolovsky, Mariano; Torino, Rafael; Martins, Carolina; Yasuda, Alexandre; Rhoton, Albert L.","Campero, Álvaro (Department of Neurological Surgery, British Hospital of Buenos Aires, Argentina; Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA); Socolovsky, Mariano (Department of Neurological Surgery, British Hospital of Buenos Aires, Argentina); Torino, Rafael (Department of Neurological Surgery, British Hospital of Buenos Aires, Argentina); Martins, Carolina (Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA); Yasuda, Alexandre (Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA); Rhoton, Albert L.

Therefore, the current study aims to summarize what PROMs are being used to assess TSA outcomes, to classify the type of measure (International society for quality of life (ISOQOL) using definitions of functioning, disability, and health (FDH), quality of life (QoL) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL)) and to compare the content of these measures by linking them to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework.MethodsA literature review was performed in three databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL to identify PROMs that were used in TSA studies. Meaningful concepts of the identified measures were extracted and linked to the relevant second-level ICF codes using standard linking rules. Outcome measures were classified as being FDH, HRQoL or QoL measures based on the content analysis.ResultThirty-five measures were identified across 400 retrieved studies. The most frequently used PROM was the American Shoulder and Elbow Society score accounting for 21% (246) of the total citations, followed by the single item pain-related scale like visual analog scale (17%) and Simple Shoulder Test (12%). Twelve PROMs with 190 individual items fit inclusion criteria for conceptual analysis. Most codes (65%) fell under activity and participation categories. The top 3 most predominant codes were: sensation of pain (b280; 13%), hand and arm use (d445; 13%), recreational activity (d920; 8%). Ten PROMs included in this study were categorized as FDH measures, one as HRQoL measure, and one as unknown.ConclusionsOur study demonstrated that there is an inconsistency and lack of clarity in conceptual frameworks of identified PROMs. Despite this, common core constructs are evaluated. Decision-making about individual studies or core sets for outcome measurement for TSA would be advanced by considering our results, patient priorities and measurement properties.","Joy MacDermid was supported by a Canadian Institutes of Health Research Chair in Gender, Work and Health and the Dr. James Roth Chair in Musculoskeletal Measurement and Knowledge Translation.

Between July 2011 and March 2013, 61 patients with PmVSD underwent perventricular concentric device closure using a minimally invasive inferior sternotomy approach. The basal diameter of the PmVSD ranged from 2.5 to 7 mm. The diameter of the occlusion device waist ranged from 4 to 8 mm. A ventricular septal aneurysm or an adhesive tricuspid valve was present in 49 patients. Multiple orifices in the aneurysm were treated in ten patients, including dispersed orifices in four patients and comparatively concentrated orifices in the remaining six patients. The occlusion devices were deployed via the right ventricle with TEE guidance and no cardiopulmonary bypass. Complete shunt occlusion was achieved for all the patients in the operating room. The orifices of the ventricular septal aneurysm were closed in 46 patients, with the left disc of the concentric devices placed in the aneurysms, whereas the PmVSDs in the remaining 15 patients were closed from the ventricular septal defect (VSD) basal part following the rule that the upper rim of the PmVSD be more than 2 mm from the aortic valve. Ventricular premature beats occurred in one patient. The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 21 months (median 13.5 ± 8.2 months), and the patients had stable heart function postoperatively. None of the patients had more than mild valvular regurgitation, and no worsening regurgitation was observed in those who had tricuspid or aortic regurgitation before surgery. No complete atrioventricular block, position shift of the occlusion devices, thrombosis, or residual VSD occurred during the follow-up period. The perventricular concentric device closure of PmVSD with an inferior sternotomy in selected patients is a safe, feasible, and simple treatment. The concentric device is easier to anchor than the eccentric device and has proved to be a reasonable choice for PmVSD occlusion, especially in patients with a perimembranous aneurysm formation or PmVSD extending to the inflow tract.","We thank A.

Central nervous system manifestations are rare in FMF.
CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 37-year-old right-handed man with FMF diagnosed at 17 the age of years and successfully treated with colchicine. The patient was born in Algeria and lived in France since he was four years old. He had a brother who had multiple sclerosis. When the patient was 23 years old, he experienced diplopia and leg numbness that resolved spontaneously without treatment. Ten years later, new neurological events appeared every six months and were treated with corticoid-steroids. The diagnosis of MS was made. In 2006, he was hospitalized for new explorations in order to search for neuro-Behçet's disease, because of the development of a canker sore. There was no argument for neuro-Behçet's disease.
DISCUSSION: Neurological complications of FMF are rare. It is important to rule out a neuro-Behçet disease in a FMF patient with neurological disorders. Previous studies and case reports on the association between FMF and MS have failed to draw a clear conclusion as to whether this is a true association or a simple coincidence.

Nevertheless, P&R systems in SEE are rarely critically assessed, warranting a detailed and wider-encompassing exploration.ObjectiveOur study provides a comparative assessment of P&R processes for patent-protected medicines in ten SEE countries—EU member states: Croatia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria; and non-EU countries: Albania, Montenegro, Serbia, North Maceodina, Bosnia and Herzegovina. P&R systems are compared and evaluated through a research framework that focuses on: (1) public financing of patent-protected medicines, (2) definition of benefit packages, (3) requirements for the submission of reimbursement dossiers, (4) assessment and appraisal processes, (5) reimbursement decision making, (6) processes that occur post reimbursement, and (7) pricing. The study aims to contribute to the discussion on improving the efficiency and quality of P&R of patent-protected medicines in the region.MethodsWe conducted a non-systematic literature review of published literature, as well as policy briefs and reports on healthcare systems in the SEE region along with legal documents framing the P&R procedures in local languages. The information gathered from these various sources was then discussed and clarified through structured telephone interviews with relevant national experts from each SEE country, mainly current and former senior officials and/or executives of the funding and assessment/ appraisal bodies (total of 20 interviews conducted in late 2019).ResultsCapacity building through sharing knowledge and information on successful reforms across borders is an opportunity for SEE countries to further develop their P&R policies and increase (equitable) access to patent-protected medicines (especially expensive medicines), increasing affordability and containing costs. Simple yet robust and systematic decision-making frameworks that rely on international health technology assessment (HTA) procedures and are based on the pursuit of transparency seem to be the most cost-effective approach to strengthening P&R systems in SEE.ConclusionsFurther reforms aiming to develop transparent and robust national decision-making frameworks (including oversight) and build institutional HTA-related and decision-making capacity are awaited in most of SEE countries, especially the non-EU members. In non-EU SEE countries, these efforts could increase access to patent-protected medicines, which is—at the moment—very limited. The EU-member SEE countries operate more developed P&R systems but could further benefit from developing their procedures, oversight and value-for-money assessment toolbox and capacity, hence further improving the transparency and efficiency of procedures that regulate access to patent-protected medicines.","We kindly thank the reviewers for their valuable comments, which significantly improved the paper and to Bartalan Nemeth for providing insight on pricing and reimbursement of medicines in Hungary.",The work of Ana Bobinac and Igor Banović is partly supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project UIP-2019-04-3721 and the European Union from the European Social Fund under the project Health Observatory (UP.04.2.1.06.0045).,Applied Health Economics and Health Policy,,,"Cost-Benefit Analysis; Croatia; Europe; Europe, Eastern; Humans; Hungary; Nonprescription Drugs",2021-09-23,2021,2021-09-23,2021-11,19,6,915-927,Closed,Article,"Vončina, Luka; Strbad, Tea; Fürst, Jurij; Dimitrova, Maria; Kamusheva, Maria; Vila, Megi; Mardare, Ileana; Hristova, Kristina; Harsanyi, Andras; Atanasijević, Dragana; Banović, Igor; Bobinac, Ana","Vončina, Luka (Faculty of Health Studies, University of Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia); Strbad, Tea (Croatian Health Insurance Fund, Zagreb, Croatia); Fürst, Jurij (Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia, Ljubljana, Slovenia); Dimitrova, Maria (Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria); Kamusheva, Maria (Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria); Vila, Megi (F.

Steatorrhea developed subsequently. Serial studies in the ensuing ten years showed fat absorption to be fairly constant. While the patient was able to increase absolute fat absorption upon fat loading, this caused bloating and diarrhea even though the per cent fat absorption did not change markedly. Nitrogen absorption was impaired, but the patient remained in positive nitrogen balance. There seemed to have been some improvement in nitrogen absorption, with time, after surgery. Three to five years after surgery megaloblastic anemia secondary to vitamin B12deficiency developed. Vitamin B12in physiologic doses is absorbed in the ileum, which was removed surgically in our patient. Patients with extensive ileal resection require permanent parenteral administration of vitamin B12The patient absorbed other water-soluble substances normally. The need for supplementary calcium, magnesium or vitamin D was never established in this patient, although they may be required by some patients after massive intestinal resection, especially if the fat intake is maintained at a level resulting in frequent loose movements. Consequently, restriction of fat intake to 30 to 50 gm. daily, and parenteral administration of vitamin B12seem to constitute the only nutritional therapy necessary for patients who have no ileum. Patients who have no jejunum, but have an intact ileum, do not require any specific dietary therapy. If the ileum is completely absent, the critical minimal amount of jejunum necessary for satisfactory absorption of water-soluble nutrients would appear to be 1 to 4 feet. These simple rules provide a clinical approach to the management of patients who have had extensive removal of intestine.",,,American Journal of Clinical Nutrition,,,"Anemia; Anemia, Macrocytic; Calcium; Calcium, Dietary; Diet; Diet Therapy; Dietary Fats; Drug Therapy; Fats; Humans; Ileum; Intestines; Jejunum; Magnesium; Malabsorption Syndromes; Postoperative Complications; Surgical Procedures, Operative; Vitamin B 12; Vitamin B 12 Deficiency; Vitamins",1965-08,1965,,1965-08,17,2,64-72,Closed,Article,"SCHEINER, ELLEN; SHILS, MAURICE E.; VANAMEE, PARKER","SCHEINER, ELLEN (Division of Experimental Surgery and Physiology, and the Andre and Bella Meyer Physiology Laboratory, Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research; and the Department of Medicine, Memorial and James Ewing Hospitals, New York, New York; Sloan-Kettering Institute, Senior Clinical Trainee, Memorial Hospital, recipient of USPHS Grant CRT-5110); SHILS, MAURICE E.

This is why we have proposed to create and validate an ethical and a methodological grid in the field of cosmetic surgery.
METHODS: A questionnaire had been mailed to 40 cosmetic surgeons. The questionnaire was voluntary and simple and included two open questions and the possibility of giving one's opinion on this subject. The first question was: ""Please mention, without describing your first ten methodological criteria, when you decide to evaluate a scientific publication concerning cosmetic surgery"". The second question was written exactly in the same way, except that the word ""methodological"" was replaced by the word ""ethical"".
RESULTS: In the methodological field, our results are the same as the classical criteria that permit answers the following questions: what did you do?, why did you do?, how did you do?, what did you find?, what is the meaning of this finding?, what is the future of this finding? Finally, except for the importance of comparing before and after photography, our criteria are not so different from the methodological criteria of all scientific studies. In the ethical field, in a decreasing order, we found the balance of benefits and risks, the probity of the author, the respect for the a priori equivalence clause, the disclosure of conflicts interest, the quality of the iconography, the respect for legislation, the transparency on the effective work of each author, the existence of rules for early stopping of the study and the transparency on preliminary animal studies if necessary.

This supranumerary muscle situated in front of the calcaneum can be taken for a soft tissue tumor. The purpose of this work was to report a series of 21 patients with an accessory soleus muscle and to present the characteristic features, diagnostic methods, and treatment indications and modalities.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This series included 20 patients (one symptomatic bilateral case), fourteen men and six women, mean age 25 years. Seventeen patients practiced sports and ten had had a prior operation. All patients complained of exercise-related pain. The physical examination was normal with the exception of a tumefaction, which was soft at rest and hard at triceps contraction against resistance, lying laterally to the Achilles tendon. We studied plain x-rays, ultrasound studies, computed tomographies, and electromyograms and later MRI which became the reference method to demonstrate the details of normal muscle structure. Ten patients (one bilateral case) were not particularly bothered by the supernumerary muscle. Functional treatment was given and provided patient satisfaction. For the other ten patients, who wished to continue their physical activities, two underwent fasciotomy (including our first case where fasciotomy was undertaken because a tumor was suspected) and eight underwent resection of the supranumerary muscle.
RESULTS: The patients were followed for 6 to 19 years. Outcome was very good in all patients who were free of pain and had complete joint movement with symmetrical muscle force. Normal sports activities were resumed.
DISCUSSION: The accessory soleus muscle is found in 10% of individuals. It is often asymptomatic. The muscle inserts on the anterior aspect of the soleus muscle or on the posterior aspect of the tibia or the muscles of the deep posterior compartment. It lies anterior to the calcaneal tendon and terminates on the calcaneal tendon or the superior or medial aspect of the calcaneus via fleshy fibers or a distinct tendon. Frequent in primates, this anatomic variant is present during embryological development. Its persistence depends on phylogenetic evolution. Among other hypotheses (exercise-induced intermittent claudication, compression of the tibial nerve, excessive tension on the nerve innervating the accessory soleus muscle), this supranumerary muscle is generally considered to be the cause of a localized compartment syndrome. Pain experienced during exercise is the only symptom regularly reported by patients. A careful examination is required to rule out another local cause. Besides tumefaction lateral to the Achilles tendon, often found bilaterally, there is no other clinical sign. Plain x-rays, ultrasound and computed tomography simply demonstrate a ""mass"" in front of the Achilles tendon. MRI is the examination of choice enabling confirmation of the muscle nature of the mass and ruling out the possible diagnosis of tumor. Since there is no risk of aggravation, surgical treatment can be avoided if there is no complaint. If the patient is seriously impaired, surgery can be proposed. In our opinion, complete resection of the supernumerary muscle is the safest solution and should be preferred over simple fasciotomy.",,,Revue de Chirurgie Orthopédique et Traumatologique,,,"Achilles Tendon; Adult; Athletic Injuries; Electromyography; Fasciotomy; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Pain; Physical Therapy Modalities; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2005-05,2005,,2005-05,91,3,232-238,Closed,Article,"Kouvalchouk, J.-F.; Lecocq, J.; Parier, J.; Fischer, M.","Kouvalchouk, J.-F.

PATIENTS AND METHOD: We conducted a retrospective survey that covered the period from January 2000 to December 2003, during which 54 patients of all ages were treated for traumatic cataract. The epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic parameters and the functional results were analyzed using the Epi info software, version 6.
RESULTS: Traumatic cataracts accounted for 6.9% of all cataracts. The patients were aged from 3 to 59 years, with a mean age of 26.9+/-15.7 years; males were predominant (70.4%) with a ratio of 2.4. Schoolchildren were the most frequent (37%), followed by manual laborers (33.3%). The cataracts resulted from recreational accidents (37%), physical abuse (18.5%), fights (14.8%), and home accidents (13%). Total cataracts accounted for the majority of the cases (58.2%). Forty-three patients (78.2%) had unilateral blindness at the first consultation. Only 30 eyes out of 55 were operated (54.6%): 13 with simple extracapsular extraction and 15 with extracapsular extraction with implantation in the posterior chamber and two with extracapsular extraction with implantation in the anterior chamber. Ten eyes out of 30 (33.3%) presented intraoperative vitreous leakage. Only 11 eyes out of 15 recovered visual acuity corrected to 3/10 or better.
DISCUSSION: Epidemiologically, the frequency of traumatic cataract doubled in 5 years, involving school-age boys most particularly. Unilateral cataracts are the rule. Anatomical and functional prognosis is worse for open injury. For different reasons, close to the half of the patients did not have surgery (44%).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten horses with histopathologically confirmed abdominal neoplasia, in which a PF analysis was performed, were included in this retrospective study. PF was analyzed for total protein concentration and a nucleated cell count was performed. Using cytological criteria of malignancy, the PF samples were evaluated regarding their probability of malignancy.
RESULTS: Cytologic classification of cells according to criteria of malignancy allowed a positive cytologic diagnosis of neoplasia in 5 out of 10 peritoneal fluid samples. Malignant lymphoma was the most commonly diagnosed neoplasia (3/10) and could be identified by cytology in 2/3 cases. In 1/2 horses with plasma cell myeloma neoplastic cells were similarly found. Malignant melanoma (2/10) was diagnosed using cytology in one case (presence of melanin-containing cells). Cytological diagnosis of malignant neoplasia was established in the only horse with gastric squamous cell carcinoma, but the morphology of the identified tumour cells did not allow a specific diagnosis. Thus, a definitive diagnosis was achieved in 4/5 horses with proven abdominal neoplasia. The horses with adenocarcinoma (1/10) and haemangiosarcoma (1/10) had no evidence of neoplasia based on cytological findings. No relationship between total protein concentration or the nucleated cell count with the histolopathological diagnosis of abdominal neoplasia was found. Abnormal mitotic figures were considered of greater diagnostic value than the overall mitotic rate.
CONCLUSION: The implementation of nuclear criteria of malignancy in the cytologic evaluation of PF samples allows the identification of neoplastic cells to an acceptable degree. For this purpose, the knowledge of the highly variable morphological features of mesothelial cells is essential. The absence of malignant cells does not rule out abdominal neoplasia.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: PF cytology should be considered as a valuable, minimally invasive, simple, and rapid diagnostic technique in horses with suspected abdominal neoplasia.",,,Tierärztliche Praxis Ausgabe G Großtiere / Nutztiere,,,"Abdominal Neoplasms; Adenocarcinoma; Animals; Ascitic Fluid; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Duodenal Neoplasms; Hemangiosarcoma; Horse Diseases; Horses; Lymphoma; Melanoma; Mesentery; Multiple Myeloma; Peritoneal Neoplasms; Stomach Neoplasms",2012,2012,2018-01-06,2012,40,02,85-93,Closed,Article,"Recknagel, S; Nicke, M; Schusser, G F","Recknagel, S (Medizinische Tierklinik, der Universität Leipzig, Leipzig. recknagel@vetmed.uni-leipzig.de); Nicke, M (); Schusser, G F ()",,"Recknagel, S (Leipzig University); Nicke, M (); Schusser, G F ()",11,0,0.2,2.16,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1078552032,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3009 Veterinary Sciences; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis; 3215 Reproductive Medicine",

METHODS: A cohort of 13 973 subjects aged 35-74 years who did not have metabolic syndrome but took the initial testing during 1997-2006 was formed to derive a risk score which tended to predict the incidence of MS. Multivariate logistic regression was used to derive the risk functions and using the 'check-up center' (Taipei training cohort)as the overall cohort. Rules based on these risk functions were evaluated in the remaining three centers (as testing cohort). Risk functions were produced to detect the MS on a training sample using the multivariate logistic regression models. Started with those variables that could predict the MS through univariate models, we then constructed multivariable logistic regression models in a stepwise manner which eventually could include all the variables. The predictability of the model was evaluated by areas under curve (AUC) the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) followed by the testification of its diagnostic property on the testing sample. Once the final model was defined, the next step was to establish rules to characterize 4 different degrees of risks based on the cut points of these probabilities, after being transformed into normal distribution by log-transformation.
RESULTS: At baseline, the range of the proportion of MS was 23.9% and the incidence of MS in 5-years was 11.7% in the non-MS cohort. The final multivariable logistic regression model would include ten risk factors as: age, history of diabetes, contractive pressure, fasting blood-glucose, triglyceride, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index and blood uric acid. AUC was 0.827(95% CI: 0.814-0.839) that could predict the development of MS within the next 5 years. The curve also showed adequate performance in the three tested samples, with the AUC and 95% CI as 0.813 (0.789-0.837), 0.826 (0.800-0.852) and 0.794 (0.768-0.820), respectively. After labeling the degrees of the four risks, it was showed that over 17.6% of the incidence probability was in the population under mediate risk while over 59.0% of them was in the high risk group, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Both predictability and reliability of our Metabolic Syndrome Risk Score Model, derived based on Taiwan MJ Longitudinal Health-checkup-based Population Database, were relatively satisfactory in the testing cohort. This model was simple, with practicable predictive variables and feasible form on degrees of risk. This model not only could help individuals to assess the situation of their own risk on MS but could also provide guidance on the group surveillance programs in the community regarding the development of MS.",,,Chinese Journal of Epidemiology,,,Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Metabolic Syndrome; Middle Aged; Physical Examination; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Taiwan,2013-09,2013,,2013-09,34,9,874-8,Closed,Article,"Yang, Xing-hua; Tao, Qiu-shan; Sun, Feng; Cao, Chun-keng; Zhan, Si-yan","Yang, Xing-hua (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, China.); Tao, Qiu-shan (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Health Science Center of Peking University.); Sun, Feng (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Health Science Center of Peking University.); Cao, Chun-keng (MJ Health Management Organization, Taiwan.); Zhan, Si-yan (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Health Science Center of Peking University.)",,"Yang, Xing-hua (Capital Medical University); Tao, Qiu-shan (Peking University); Sun, Feng (Peking University); Cao, Chun-keng (MJ Health Management Organization, Taiwan.); Zhan, Si-yan (Peking University)",12,4,0.41,1.76,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1078826648,42 Health Sciences; 4202 Epidemiology,

The aims of this study were 1) to monitor a selection of subjective, physiological and performance variables in elite athletes and sedentary subjects following a westerly flight across five time zones, and 2) to examine whether the promotion of sleep by means of a low-dose benzodiazepine drug influences these responses to transmeridian travel. Subjects comprised eight members of the British men's gymnastics squad, aged 18-30 years, and nine members of the British Olympic Association's support staff, aged 24- 55 years (4 females, 5 males). Subjects were pair-matched for age, sex and athleticism (apart from one person) and assigned to either the treatment (n = 9) or placebo (n = 8) group. All subjects travelled from U.K., arriving at Tallahassee, Florida, at approximately 22:00 hours local time. A test battery was administered to the subjects at 07:00, 12:00, 17:00 and 21:00 hours on the first full day of arrival (this was designated day one) and then on alternate days (day 3, day 5 and day 7). Immediately before retiring to bed on days 1, 2 and 3, subjects were administered, in a double-blind fashion, either 10mg of temazepam or a placebo. Measures in the test battery included sleep quality, sleep length, subjective jet lag (one-to-ten simple analogue scale), tympanic temperature, one-, two-, four- and eight-choice reaction time, grip strength (left and right), leg strength and back strength. Over the 24 h of each test day, subjects also recorded the volume of each urine voided. Data were analysed with a repeated measures general linear model. Alpha was set at 0.01 to control for type I errors with multiple dependent variables. Mean subjective jet lag reduced from 4.6 units to baseline, and mean sleep quality improved by 2.0 units from day 1 to day 5 (P<0.001), after which no further alterations were noted. Subjective jet lag, left and right grip strength and choice reaction time all showed post-flight day x time of day interactions (P < 0.01). On day 1, these variables deteriorated as the day progressed to the worst recorded values. On days 3, 5 and 7, diurnal variations with the conventional high in the early evening and morning-to-evening differences of about 10% were evident. There was a trend for the reduction in subjective jet lag over the post-flight days to be more rapid following ingestion of a low dose of temazepam (P= 0.037). We cannot rule out the possibility that this could be a type I error, since none of the treatment by day interactions reached the alpha level of significance (set at 0.01). The morning-to-evening variations of body temperature and grip strength were greater in the young athletes than in the older sedentary support staff (P < 0.01). Sleep quality was greater in the athletic subjects after the first full day in Tallahassee. These results suggest that the nightly administration of a low dose (10 mg) of temazepam has little influence on the recovery of subjective, physiological and performance measures following a westward flight across five time zones. In both the treatment and control groups, subjective jet lag and performance were worst in the evening of the first full day after arrival, and the young athletes slept better than the older support staff that same night. This illustrates the importance of monitoring jet lag symptoms and performance variables at different times of day following a flight to a new time zone.",,,International Journal of Sports Medicine,,,Adult; Analysis of Variance; Anti-Anxiety Agents; Body Temperature; Circadian Rhythm; Double-Blind Method; Female; Gymnastics; Hand Strength; Humans; Jet Lag Syndrome; Male; Physical Fitness; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Recovery of Function; Sleep; Temazepam,2001-04,2001,2001-12-31,2001-04,22,03,166-174,Closed,Article,"Reilly, T.; Atkinson; Budgett","Reilly, T.

Drawing on qualitative research, the authors propose disjunctions-of-conjunctions (DOC) decision rules that generalize well-studied decision models, such as disjunctive, conjunctive, lexicographic, and subset conjunctive rules. They propose two machine-learning methods to estimate cognitively simple DOC rules. They observe consumers' consideration sets for global positioning systems for both calibration and validation data. They compare the proposed methods with both machine-learning and hierarchical Bayes methods, each based on five extant compensatory and noncompensatory rules. For the validation data, the cognitively simple DOC-based methods predict better than the ten benchmark methods on an information theoretic measure and on hit rates. The results are robust with respect to format by which consideration is measured, sample, and presentation of profiles.

Our special discretization procedure reduces the scatter in integral quantities, such as drag force, and quantifies the solution convergence error. We assume transition to linear (−1) convergence rate for different sets of TRT parameters and use this assumption to provide a simple extrapolation scheme. After establishing the accurate reference values of drag for a wide range of porosities, 0.26–0.78, we show a ten-fold decrease in the drag error using the suggested extrapolations. This error decrease allows the simple LBM/BB scheme to reach an accuracy of the high-order interpolated boundary schemes.

RI extracts hidden patterns from instances in terms of rules. This paper proposes a logic-based rule induction (LBRI) classifier based on a switching function approach. LBRI generates binary rules by using a novel minimization function, which depends on simple and powerful bitwise operations. Initially, LBRI generates instance codes by encoding the dataset with standard binary code and then generates prime cubes (PC) for all classes from the instance codes by the proposed reduced offset method. Finally, LBRI selects the most effective PC of the current classes and adds them into the binary rule set that belongs to the current class. Each binary rule represents an If–Then rule for the rule induction classifiers. The proposed LBRI classifier is based on basic logic functions. It is a simple and effective method, and it can be used by intelligent systems to solve real-life classification/prediction problems in areas such as health care, online/financial banking, image/voice recognition, and bioinformatics. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to six rule induction algorithms; decision table, Ripper, C4.5, REPTree, OneR, and ICRM by using nineteen different datasets.

When the attractive tail of the potential is given by an inverse power law with a power greater than two, the reflection phase is accurately approximated by a simple algebraic formula. In an example defined by a 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential, this simple modified quantization rule gives highly accurate energy levels in the whole spectrum; the error relative to the level spacing is uniformly near .

While these taggers obtain high accuracy, linguistic information is captured indirectly, typically in tens of thousands of lexical and contextual probabilities. In [Brill 92], a trainable rule-based tagger was described that obtained performance comparable to that of stochastic taggers, but captured relevant linguistic information in a small number of simple non-stochastic rules. In this paper, we describe a number of extensions to this rule-based tagger. First, we describe a method for expressing lexical relations in tagging that stochastic taggers are currently unable to express. Next, we show a rule-based approach to tagging unknown words. Finally, we show how the tagger can be extended into a k-best tagger, where multiple tags can be assigned to words in some cases of uncertainty.",,,,,,,1994-01-01,1994,,1994-01-01,,,,Closed,Article,"Brill, Eric","Brill, Eric ()",,"Brill, Eric ()",5,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091528570,"46 Information and Computing Sciences; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4704 Linguistics",

The computational schemes described in publications suggest the use of simple quadratures (trapezoidal and Simpson’s rule) with a fixed number of integration’s intervals. This approach assumes manual setup of the algorithm for calculating the wave-making resistance for each new ship and makes it difficult to estimate the error of the obtained results. It is shown that the use of these simple quadratures makes it possible to obtain reliable results, but at the cost of tens of billions of calculations of the ship's surface function. The applicability of more advanced universal quadratures for calculating the mitchell’s integral is investigated: adaptive Newton-Cotes rules, Gauss-Kronrod rules and Clenshaw-Curtis quadratures. As a result, it is established that the Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature provides a reliable and efficient calculation of the mitchell’s integral. The computational scheme using this quadrature allows you to build an automatic algorithm for calculating the ship's wave-making resistance by type ship method.",,,Russian Journal of Water Transport,,,,2022-12-20,2022,2022-12-20,,,73,206-215,All OA; Gold,Article,"Platov, Alexander J.; Platov, Juri I.","Platov, Alexander J.

In this paper, we develop and test a new truncation heuristic or resolving the start-up problem. Given a finite sequence, the truncation rule deletes initial observations until the width of the marginal confidence interval about the truncated sample mean is minimized. This rule is easy to implement, has strong intuitive appeal, and is remarkably effective in mitigating initialization bias. We illustrate the performance of the heuristic by comparison with enhanced implementations of alternative truncation rules proposed in the literature. All rules are applied to output sequences generated by ten runs each of four representative queuing simulations. Results confirm the significance of the start-up problem and demonstrate that simple truncation heuristics can solve this problem. All of the rules tested are shown to provide improved accuracy without undue loss of precision. We conclude that all four of the rules tested represent attractive solutions to the start-up problem.",,,SIMULATION,,,,1997-12,1997,2016-08-18,1997-12,69,6,323-334,Closed,Article,"White, K.

It integrates midlevel cues including scoreboard information and shot transition patterns into event classification rules. First, a simple scoreboard detection and recognition scheme is developed to extract the game status from videos. Then, a shot transition classifier is designed to obtain the shot transition patterns, which contains several novel schemes including adaptive playfield segmentation, pitch shot detection, field shot detection, as well as infield/outfield classification. The extracted midlevel cues are used to develop an event classifier based on a Bayesian Belief Network. The network is with low complexity because the number of these cues used is small, which not only improves the generalization performance of the event classifier but also reduces system complexity as well as training efforts. Using the inference results of the network, we further derive a set of classification rules to identify baseball events. The set of rules is stored in a look-up table such that the classification is only a simple table look-up operation. The proposed approach is very simple and computational efficient. More importantly, the simulation results indicate that it identifies ten significant baseball events with 95% of precision rate and 92% of recall rate, which is very promising.","This work was supported in part by National Science Council under Grant NSC 95-2221-E-214-051 and Grant NSC 96-2221-E-130-021.

Each of the truncated rules placed those jobs which had waited for a predetermined length of time into a secondary queue. As long as jobs existed in the secondary queue, they were given a higher priority than jobs waiting in the primary queue. Each of the truncated rules sequenced jobs from the primary queue by SI while sequencing from the secondary queue was by some other priority rule. The objective of the truncated SI rules was to improve upon the tardiness problem associated with the simple SI rule without worsening greatly the good performance of SI on job flowtimes. Results indicated that the truncated rules which sequenced jobs in the secondary queue by job slack achieved the desired results better than the rules which sequenced jobs from the secondary queue by processing time. However, it was found that the implementation of these rules is complicated by the variability in the percent of jobs sequenced from the secondary queue. A second class of truncated rules which are easy to implement is developed. The performance of these rules was found to be as good as other selected rules studied.",,,Journal of Operations Management,,,,1988-12,1988,2002-06-06,1988-12,7,3-4,77-92,Closed,Article,"Fry, Timothy D.; Philipoom, Patrick R.; Blackstone, John H.","Fry, Timothy D.

In this paper, we propose a method for actionable recommendations from itemset analysis and investigate an application of the concepts of association rules—maximal-profit item selection with cross-selling effect (MPIS). This problem is about choosing a subset of items which can give the maximal profit with the consideration of cross-selling effect. A simple approach to this problem is shown to be NP-hard. A new approach is proposed with consideration of the loss rule—a rule similar to the association rule—to model the cross-selling effect. We show that MPIS can be approximated by a quadratic programming problem. We also propose a greedy approach and a genetic algorithm to deal with this problem.

The framework is derived from previous historical studies, where a selection of ten major works is analyzed and discussed. The major strengths of the suggested framework are that it is firmly grounded in previous discussions, but also that it is simple, focused on important aspects, and adaptable to any place or any time.","The author also wishes to thank the anonymous referees for helpful suggestions as well as comments from participants in the session “Structural change in the distributive trades in the long run: The impact of innovations and institutions” at the European Business History Association conference in Uppsala, Sweden, in 2013.

However, measuring, compiling and analysing trait data comes with data‐scientific challenges.   We offer 10 (mostly) simple rules, with some detailed extensions, as a guide in making critical decisions that consider the entire life cycle of trait data.   This article is particularly motivated by its last rule, that is, to propagate good practice. It has the intention of bringing awareness of how data on the traits of organisms can be collected and managed for reuse by the research community.    Trait observations are relevant to a broad interdisciplinary community of field biologists, synthesis ecologists, evolutionary biologists, computer scientists and database managers. We hope these basic guidelines can be useful as a starter for active communication in disseminating such integrative knowledge and in how to make trait data future‐proof.

Tens of Passivhauses are now built in Eastern Europe and the technology transfer raises well-known as well as specific problems, related to the difference of climate. Most previous studies about the dependence of the PH heating demand on climate have been performed by using the Koppen-Geiger climate classification. Here a more recent classification based on climate zones and climate types is used. Several tens of localities have been selected, covering all climate zones and types of Germany and two countries of Eastern Europe (Romania and Ukraine). An existing Romanian PH has been defined as a prototype and it has been conceptually moved in all localities. Simulations are performed by using the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) developed by the Passive House Institute of Darmstadt. For given climate zone and climate type, the PH heating demand clearly depends on latitude, in all three countries. A linear dependence between the PH heating demand and latitude may be used in first approximation, and this assumption works better in the climate of Eastern Europe than in Germany. A simple empirical rule is proposed for the estimation of the heating demand of a given PH .",AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank the reviewers for useful comments and suggestions.,,Sustainable Cities and Society,,,,2016-07,2016,,2016-07,24,,20-32,Closed,Article,"Badescu, Viorel; Rotar, Nicolae; Budea, Sanda","Badescu, Viorel (Candida Oancea Institute, Polytechnic University of Bucharest, Spl.

General results are obtained and applied to the case of the transition metal nickel by using the resulting matrix to calculate the electron energy loss spectrum. Agreement between the predicted and observed spectra is found to be reasonable in view of the simplicity of the model. By using a generalisation of the Thomas-Reich-Kuhn sum rule the authors find that the valence predicted by the model is 10.9+or-0.4 electrons, in good agreement with the required ten electrons.",,,Journal of Physics F Metal Physics,,,,1980-06,1980,2000-11-30,1980-06,10,6,1341,Closed,Article,"Dzwig, P; Beeby, J L","Dzwig, P (Dept. of Phys., Univ. of Leicester, Leicester, UK); Beeby, J L (Dept. of Phys., Univ. of Leicester, Leicester, UK)",,"Dzwig, P (University of Leicester); Beeby, J L (University of Leicester)",1,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1059081748,51 Physical Sciences; 5106 Nuclear and Plasma Physics,

The conformance with Dyar's (1890) rule of the individual species was also determined and is discussed in terms of their life histories. Neboissoperla alpina has 11 instars and does not conform with Dyar's rule. Riekoperla rugosa, Acruroperla atra and Austropentura victoria have 10–11, 12 and 14 instars respectively, and conform well with Dyar's rule. Dinotoperla arenaria, Trinotoperla irrorata, Leptoperla kimminsi, Illiesoperla australis, Eunotoperla kershawi and Eusthenia venosa show uniform growth through the early instars, but do not conform with Dyar's rule in the later instars. D. arenaria has 11 instars, T. irrorata and L. kimminsi 12 and I. australis and E. kershawi 14. Instar number is different for male and female nymphs in E. venosa; the males have 13 and the females, 14. Instar number also varies with environmental temperature; the Aberfeldy River population of R. rugosa has 10 instars, while the population from a cooler habitat, Cement Creek, has 11. The application of the simple size frequency histogram and Janetschek (1967) methods in determining instar number in the Plecoptera are discussed. Interpretation of the simple histogram was found to be easier and as accurate as the Janetschek method. The application of Dyar's rule was useful in determining true instar peaks for both methods and in indicating the number and position of missing instar peaks for Stenoperla australis. S. australis appeared to have 12–14 instars.",,,Aquatic Insects,,,,1982-01,1982,2008-09-30,1982-01,4,3,153-166,Closed,Article,"Sephton, Dawn H.; Hynes, H. B. N.","Sephton, Dawn H.

The reference term, based on Chiew's equation of state for hard-sphere chains, requires no mixing rules. Only the attractive perturbation requires van der Waals one-fluid mixing rules. Cross parameters needed in the perturbation are obtained using pure-fluid parameters and simple combining rules. The simplifying physical assumptions required to reduce the perturbation term to the Flory χ parameter are given. Specific interactions are included by adapting the model of ten Brinke and Karasz. Model calculations for binary mixtures demonstrate that the PHSC equation can predict lower critical solution temperatures, upper critical solution temperatures and closed partial-miscibility loops. Special attention is given to the effects of polymer molecular weight, pressure, differences in segment size and differences in segment interaction energy.",,,Chemical Engineering Science,,,,1994-09,1994,,1994-09,49,17,2765-2775,All OA; Green,Article,"Song, Yuhua; Lambert, Stephen M.; Prausnitz, John M.","Song, Yuhua (Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California and Chemical Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, U.S.A.); Lambert, Stephen M.

698,pub.1007281758,10.1007/s100529901101,,,Factorisation in higher-twist single-spin amplitudes,"Abstract. We analyse the twist-three amplitudes that can give rise to single-spin asymmetries in hadron-hadron scattering; in so doing we bring to light a novel factorisation property. As already known, the requirement of an imaginary part leads to consideration of twist-three contributions that are also related to transverse spin in deep-inelastic scattering. In particular, when an external line becomes soft in contributions arising from three-parton correlators, the imaginary part of an internal propagator may be exposed. As shown here, it is precisely this kinematical configuration that permits the factorisation. An important feature is the resulting simplification: the calculation of tens of Feynman diagrams normally contributing to such processes is reduced to the evaluation of products of the simple factors derived here and known two-body helicity amplitudes. We thus find clarifying relations between the spin-dependent and spin-averaged cross-sections and formulate a series of selection rules. In addition, the kinematical dependence of such asymmetries, is rendered more transparent.",,,European Physical Journal C,,,,1999-05,1999,,1999-05,8,3,403-408,All OA; Green,Article,"Ratcliffe, P.G.","Ratcliffe, P.G.

We find g2 (cm/GW) = (3·1 - 0·5) 2 103 ¡ EpF2(2Ey/Eg)n m2E m3 g, where Ep ­ 21 eV for the semiconductors studied, Eg is the energy gap in eV, n the refractive index and F2(x) = (x m 1)3/2/x5 . This relation allows the prediction of g2 in other materials at other wavelengths, which is useful in the design of nonlinear optical elements. The strong self-defocusing observed is consistent with nonlinear refraction by the two-photon-generated free carriers.",,,Journal of Modern Optics,,,,1986-04,1986,2010-12-03,1986-04,33,4,381-386,Closed,Article,"Van Stryland, Eric W.; Guha, Shekhar; Vanherzeele, H.; Woodall, M.A.; Soileau, M.J.; Wherrett, B.S.","Van Stryland, Eric W.
