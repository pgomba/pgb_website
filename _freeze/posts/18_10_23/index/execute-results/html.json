Head over to [Text-mining PLOS articles using R](https://pagomba-blog.netlify.app/posts/08_10_23/) to read the first instance, and here to catch up with the second one: [Text-mining a Taylor & Francis journal using R](https://pagomba-blog.netlify.app/posts/11_10_23/).\n\nThis time is all about using web-scraping to obtain editorial information from scientific journals. [Biology Open](https://journals.biologists.com/bio), an Open Access journal from [The Company of Biologists](https://journals.biologists.com), have kindly offered themselves for the test. To the task at hand!\n\n### Step 1: Finding the nodes of interest\n\nBefore jumping into \"large scale\" web-scraping, is best to optimize for one target and optimize from there. For this test I´v chosen the article [Identification of SSR markers closely linked to the yellow seed coat color gene in heading Chinese cabbage (*Brassica rapa* L. ssp. *pekinensis*)](https://journals.biologists.com/bio/article/6/2/278/1846/Identification-of-SSR-markers-closely-linked-to?searchresult=1#9229331). To show the editorial data of this paper we need to click on the website button `Article history`.\n\n![Editorial info shows after click on Article history button - screenshot](editorial.PNG){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nRight clicking in the editorial data pop-up will show a menu with several options depending on your browser. If you are using Firefox, select the button `Insepct (Q)`\n\n![Right click in editorial time to show browser menu - screenshot](firefox.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nOnce you click `Inspect (Q)` (or the equivalent on your browser) the screen will split in two and will show the `html` code linked to the editorial times.\n\n![Article html code - screenshot](html_code.PNG){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nOur target nodes are going to be `wi-state` and `wi-date`. For extra points we are going to target Keywords too, but I´ll let you figure out with nodes we need to target for that (click below to get the answer)\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## Click here to find Keyword nodes\n\n`.content-metadata-keywords a`\n:::\n\n### Step 2: The code\n\nOnce again we to load the R libraries we plan to use for this project:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(rvest)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIt is time now to download the article `.html` document and extract the nodes. To avoid reading/downloading again and again the same article it is best to store it as an object (`article`) once and work with it. This way you are \"calling\" only once to the host server, reducing your footprint and being less invasive.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narticle<-read_html(\"https://journals.biologists.com/bio/article/6/2/278/1846/Identification-of-SSR-markers-closely-linked-to\")\n\neditorial_state<-article%>%\n  html_nodes(\".wi-state\")%>%\n  html_text2()\n\neditorial_date<-article%>%\n  html_nodes(\".wi-date\")%>%\n  html_text2()\n\nkeywords<-article%>%\n  html_nodes(\".content-metadata-keywords a\")%>%\n  html_text2()\n\neditorial_state\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"Received:\" \"Accepted:\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\neditorial_date\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"01 Sep 2016\" \"03 Jan 2017\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkeywords\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"Brassica rapa\"   \"Seed coat color\" \"SSR markers\"     \"Genetic map\"    \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI personally like to store the data in a data frame, with a single column containing the editorial data. On a large scale project sometimes some unexpected data (e.g. revision dates) is shipped with these nodes, and having everything on a single string adds flexibility later to extract data into new columns using the functions `mutate()` and `gsub()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\neditorial_times<-paste(editorial_state,editorial_date,collapse =  \" - \")\nkeywords <-paste(keywords,collapse =  \", \")\n\n## Storing data in a data frame\n\narticle_df<-data.frame(editorial_times,keywords)\nhead(article_df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                                editorial_times\n1 Received: 01 Sep 2016 - Accepted: 03 Jan 2017\n                                                  keywords\n1 Brassica rapa, Seed coat color, SSR markers, Genetic map\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA quick exercise of the use of `mutate` and `gsub` to clean a text string. The position of `.*` in the target pattern decides if the text to erase is before or after. More information on the use of `gsub()` and `.*` can be found here: [Remove Characters Before or After Point in String in R (Example)](https://statisticsglobe.com/r-remove-characters-before-or-after-point-in-string).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narticle_df_clean<-article_df%>%\n  #Delete everything before \"Received:\"\n  mutate(Received=gsub(\".*Received:\",\"\",editorial_times),\n         #Delete everything after \"-\"\n         Received=gsub(\"-.*\",\"\",Received))%>%\n  #Delete everything before \"Accepted:\"\n  mutate(Accepted=gsub(\".*Accepted:\",\"\",editorial_times))\n\narticle_df_clean\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                                editorial_times\n1 Received: 01 Sep 2016 - Accepted: 03 Jan 2017\n                                                  keywords      Received\n1 Brassica rapa, Seed coat color, SSR markers, Genetic map  01 Sep 2016 \n      Accepted\n1  03 Jan 2017\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow that we have the target information from one article, is time to apply this to a larger pool of articles.\n\n### Step 3: Robots and Sitemaps\n\nIf only we could find a list of articles to work with...\n\nLuckily websites often come with a sitemap for engines (e.g. Google) to be able to crawl this information and index it. Where to find this sitemap? Often, the sitemap address can be found on the `robots.txt` file, hosted in the website.\n\nThe Company of Biologists main website URL is `https://journals.biologists.com`. By adding /`robots.txt` to the URL (`https://journals.biologists.com/robots.txt`) we find a information on what is available and out of bounds for crawlers. Sometimes (this is not the case), this file includes information on best practices for text mining (e.g. polite web-scraping speed).\n\n![robots.txt - screenshot](sitemap.PNG){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nLet´s take a peek to the sitemap now:\n\n![Sitemap - Part I - screenshot](sitemap2.PNG){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nThe sitemap contains seven `.xml` links. Every publisher has their own ecosystem of sitemaps. Some are more complicated to understand than others. On this one is fair to assume they have a sitemap for each of the journals of The Company of Biologists, and we just need to keep digging further to find our target (Biology Open). Let´s now travel to the first link: <https://journals.biologists.com/data/sitemap/Site_1000001/sitemap_J1000003.xml>\n\n![Another sitemap! - screenshot](sitemap3.PNG){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nAnd its another sitemap. At least this one seems to be organized by dates, but we still don´t know for which journal they are. Let´s go find what is inside the URL <https://journals.biologists.com/data/sitemap/Site_1000001/J1000003/manifest_2012.xml>\n\n![Surprise, another sitemap - screenshot](sitemap4.PNG)\n\nThis time we finally strike gold. This seems to be a list of articles, from 2012, and from the URL (`https://journals.biologists.com/bio/`) I can see they all belong to Biology Open. In any case, is always worth travelling across different sitemaps to understand the architecture of the website and ensure we are not missing anything.\n\n### Step4: Obtaining the list of articles\n\nNow we know were to find a list of articles. Let´s say we want a list with all Biology Open articles (2012 to present. How do we get that? Notice in the sitemap, the URL address for each year, is wrapped on a `loc` node. This is what we are after to start with:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_144e98983d5c02b0f723ef192f862a7c'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\neach_year_sitemap<-read_html(\"https://journals.biologists.com/data/sitemap/Site_1000001/sitemap_J1000003.xml\")%>%\n  html_nodes(\"loc\")%>%\n  html_text()\n\neach_year_sitemap[1:5]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"https://journals.biologists.com/data/sitemap/Site_1000001/J1000003/manifest_2012.xml\"\n[2] \"https://journals.biologists.com/data/sitemap/Site_1000001/J1000003/manifest_2013.xml\"\n[3] \"https://journals.biologists.com/data/sitemap/Site_1000001/J1000003/manifest_2014.xml\"\n[4] \"https://journals.biologists.com/data/sitemap/Site_1000001/J1000003/manifest_2015.xml\"\n[5] \"https://journals.biologists.com/data/sitemap/Site_1000001/J1000003/manifest_2016.xml\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd we can now use `each_year_sitemap` in a loop to extract the articles for each of the years and store the links in `URL_data_frame`, which should have \\> 3,000 articles.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-6_593f65ac76c4ce1978f9d886c910e99c'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nURL_data_frame<-data.frame()\n\nfor (i in each_year_sitemap) {\n  \n  articles<-read_html(i)\n  \n  URL<-articles%>%\n    html_nodes(\"loc\")%>%\n    html_text2()\n  \n  URL_data_frame<-bind_rows(URL_data_frame, as.data.frame(URL))\n  \n}\n\nnrow(URL_data_frame)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 3031\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Step 5: The Loop\n\nThe loop is only slightly different to those built for the other two blogs. Keep in mind each loop is a request to a host server. A large volume or request in little time is likely to get you banned (for some time or undefinitely) from the host server. The key here is find a balance to avoid this. The speed at which each instance of the loop happens depends on host server response, computer speed and internet download speed. To avoid getting kicked out we are going to add an extra one second delay using the function `Sys.sleep(1)`.\n\nBecause extracting the data from the articles is at least going to take 3,000 seconds (50 min.) I´m going to recreate the example with a sub-sample of 200 articles\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narticle_info<- data.frame() #Empty data frame to store extracted data\nURLs<- sample(URL_data_frame$URL,100) # Grab a sample of 100 articles and store them in vector form.\n\nprogress_bar<-txtProgressBar(min = 0, max = length(URLs), initial = 0,style = 3)\n\ncount<-0\n\nfor (i in URLs) {\n  \n  article<-read_html(i)\n  \n  editorial_state<-article%>%\n    html_nodes(\".wi-state\")%>%\n    html_text2()\n  \n  if (identical(editorial_state,character(0))) {\n    editorial_state<-\"Not available\"\n  } else {\n    editorial_state<-editorial_state}\n  \n  editorial_date<-article%>%\n    html_nodes(\".wi-date\")%>%\n    html_text2()\n  \n  if (identical(editorial_date,character(0))) {\n    editorial_date<-\"Not available\"\n  } else {\n    editorial_date<-editorial_date}\n  \n  editorial_times<-paste(editorial_state,editorial_date,collapse =  \" - \")\n  \n  keywords<-article%>%\n    html_nodes(\".content-metadata-keywords a\")%>%\n    html_text2()\n  \n  keywords <-paste(keywords,collapse =  \", \")\n  \n  temp_df<-data.frame(i,editorial_times,keywords)\n  \n  article_info<-bind_rows(article_info,temp_df)\n  \n  Sys.sleep(1) #Manual delay\n  count<-count+1\n  \n  setTxtProgressBar(progress_bar,count) #progress bar\n\n  \n}\n\nclose(progress_bar) \n```\n:::\n\n\nCheck the object `article_info`. You might notice some articles don´t have the information we were looking for, but when you navigate into the website the information is there. This is because (in this particular case), the host server is \"experiencing unusual traffic\". Instead of kicking us out of the server is redirecting to a different page. Let´s be patient, and increase the Sys.sleep() to 5 seconds and hope for better results.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narticle_info<- data.frame() #Empty data frame to store extracted data\nURLs<- sample(URL_data_frame$URL,100) # Grab a sample of 100 articles and store them in vector form.\n\nprogress_bar<-txtProgressBar(min = 0, max = length(URLs), initial = 0,style = 3)\n\ncount<-0\n\nfor (i in URLs) {\n  \n  article<-read_html(i)\n  \n  editorial_state<-article%>%\n    html_nodes(\".wi-state\")%>%\n    html_text2()\n  \n  if (identical(editorial_state,character(0))) {\n    editorial_state<-\"Not available\"\n  } else {\n    editorial_state<-editorial_state}\n  \n  editorial_date<-article%>%\n    html_nodes(\".wi-date\")%>%\n    html_text2()\n  \n  if (identical(editorial_date,character(0))) {\n    editorial_date<-\"Not available\"\n  } else {\n    editorial_date<-editorial_date}\n  \n  editorial_times<-paste(editorial_state,editorial_date,collapse =  \" - \")\n  \n  keywords<-article%>%\n    html_nodes(\".content-metadata-keywords a\")%>%\n    html_text2()\n  \n  keywords <-paste(keywords,collapse =  \", \")\n  \n  temp_df<-data.frame(i,editorial_times,keywords)\n  \n  article_info<-bind_rows(article_info,temp_df)\n  \n  Sys.sleep(5) #Manual delay - 5 seconds\n  count<-count+1\n  \n  setTxtProgressBar(progress_bar,count) #progress bar\n\n  \n}\n\nclose(progress_bar) \n```\n:::\n\n\nCheck the object `article_info`. Slightly better now? This is why is important to find the right balance finding the best time for each instance of the loop... which usually mean you are going to spend weeks/months when targeting LARGE volumes of articles.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(article_info,10)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Extra\n\nThere is no need to restart the loop if some data is missing. Is easier to filter the URLs without info and feed these to the loop again.\n\n### References:\n\nGómez Barreiro, P. (2023). Text-mining a Taylor & Francis journal using R.
